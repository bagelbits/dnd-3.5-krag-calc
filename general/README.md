TO DO:
================

* domain_feet and class tables should eventually have their book columns correspond to a book id instead of a piece of text.
* Have database generate text-based spell list
* Ability to add spells directly into the database, potentially as a form. Actually..... I could told set-up a quick and dirty form on fuzzybitproductions.com and give it out, then I could format the data nicely! :D
