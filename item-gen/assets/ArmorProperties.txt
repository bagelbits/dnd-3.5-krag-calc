RADIANT 
Price: +4 bonus 
Property: Armor 
Caster Level: 9th 
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) abjuration 
Activation: — 

This armor shimmers with a variety of hues, and it feels slick to the touch. 
A suit of armor that has this property grants resistance 10 against all energy attacks (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic). When you are the subject of an energy attack, the armor also radiates light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage absorbed (to a maximum of 10 rounds). This light is sufficient to brightly illuminate a 30-foot-radius area and casts shadowy illumination in a 60­foot-radius area. 
If the armor absorbs more energy damage while it is radiating light, the first effect overlaps (does not stack with) the effect that was already in place. For example, if the armor absorbs 4 points of damage from one attack and another 6 points from an attack 2 rounds later, it radiates light for a total of 8 consecutive rounds (4 -2 + 6). Likewise, if the armor absorbs 10 points from one attack and another 5 points from an attack 2 rounds later, it radiates light for 10 consecutive rounds (because 8 rounds remain from the earlier effect, continuing past the end of the second effect's 5 rounds). 
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy. Cost to Create: Varies. 

RANGED

shields) 
Caster Level: 5th 
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) transmutation 
Activation: — 

This streamlined, gray metallic shield is keenly balanced and features a razor-sharp edge. 
While using a ranged shield, you can throw it in combat. The thrown shield has a range increment of 30 feet. While in the air, the shield is treated in all ways as a ranged weapon, and it cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with appropriate feats. Regardless of your size, a ranged buckler or ranged light shield deals 1d6 points of slashing damage, and a ranged heavy shield deals 1d8 points. You add your Strength modifier and the shield's enhancement bonus (but not its effective bonus from this or other special properties) to this base damage. 
After you have thrown it, a ranged shield flies through the air back to you. It returns just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again on that turn). You do not benefit from its shield bonus to AC while it is not in your possession. 
Catching a ranged shield when it comes back is a free action. If you can't catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the shield drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
