#Special Materials: Five percent of armor or shields are made
#of special materials, such as adamantine, darkwood, dragonhide,
#or mithral. Tables 1-1 through 1-4 summarize the effects of the
#most common special materials used in armor and shields; see
#Special Materials, DMG 283, for more details. All adamantine,
#darkwood, dragonhide, and mithral items are automatically of
#masterwork quality, and the costs in Tables 1-1 through 1-4
#include masterwork costs.
