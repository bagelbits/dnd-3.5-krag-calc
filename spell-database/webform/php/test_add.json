A moment ago only works on spells cast the previous round, and only on the most recent useable spell. All of the spell's choices - such as range, direction and number of targets - are identical. If the spell being copied allowed a saving throw or spell resistance, then those saves or resistance checks are rerolled. Spells that require a material component or an XP sacrifice do not require them again when copied with a moment ago.\n    Material Component: A piece of parchment."}
