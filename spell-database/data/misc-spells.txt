Components: V
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
    This spell changes into a natural animal (that is, a creature with the animal type). This spell is usually found in tomes with a specific animal in mind (bat form or wolf form, for example). The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than your normal form and cannot have more HD than you have levels. Upon changing, you regain hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide the other benefits of resting for a day; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.
    You acquire the physical and natural abilities of the animal while retaining your own mind. Physical abilities include Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores and natural size. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite attacks, swoop and rake attacks, and constriction), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flying with wings. Other nonmagical abilities (such as an owl's low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.
    Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.
    Your new scores and faculties are average ones for the species into which you have been transformed.
    You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level, hit points (despite any change in Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus. and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) You can cast spells for which you have components. You need a human-like voice for verbal components and human-like hands for somatic components.
    Your new form may be disorienting. Any time you are in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or suffer a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes. Creatures who are changed for a long time (years and years) grow accustomed to their new form and can overcome some of these drawbacks (at the GM's discretion).
    When the change occurs, your equipment and clothing, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature that does not use equipment, the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material components and foci melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (an albino ape, for instance), the subject's essential equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.
    You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species.

    To cast the spell, the receptacle must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
    Focus: A receptacle for the soul, typically a bottle or jar, but any intact, inanimate object that closes will do.

    The undead creatures you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number. all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.)
    Zombies created by this spell do not count against the HD total for undead created by animate dead, and vice versa. The gems required must be.
    Material Component: You must place a black gem into the corpse's mouth or eye socket, worth 100 gp. The magic of the spell turns this gem into a worthless, burned-out shell.

    By invoking Nyarlathotep, you change your physical form into any one creature or object you wish. The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size category larger than our normal form. You remain in the new form until you cast this spell again, or until a preexisting condition is met (a certain date, an action performed, and so on). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.
    You acquire time physical and natural abilities of the animal while retaining your own mind. Physical abilities include Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores and natural size. Natural abilities include mundane movement capabilities (such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings), but not magical flight and other magical forms of travel. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of magical ability, so they are not granted by this spell. Other nonmagical abilities (such as an owl's low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.
    Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.
    Your new scores and faculties are average ones for the species into which you have been transformed, although you can take the specific appearance of an individual known to you if you wish.
    You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level, hit points (despite any change in Constitution score), base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) You can cast spells for which you have components. You need a human-like voice for verbal components and human-like hands for somatic components.
    If you turn into an inanimate object. it will have a fleshy consistency (no hardness), but it can appear to be anything (such as stone, plastic, or wood). Objects cannot take actions. As an object, you age as that object (very slowly). If the object is destroyed, however, you are slain.
    When the change occurs, your equipment and clothing, if any, does not transform to match the new form.
    You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species.

Components: V, S, XP
Casting Time: 1d100 minutes
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One summoned deity
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell summons an avatar, Outer God, or Great Old One. A 50% chance, +1% per level of the caster(s), exists that the deity will heed the call (if more than one caster is involved, caster level is the total of all casters). The deity appears where you designate and acts on your initiative count. A called deity is free to act as it wishes, remain for as long as it wants, or leave immediately, if it chooses. Those foolish or desperate enough to cast such a spell often have some sort of offering to appease the deity, perhaps in hopes that it will do something in return.
    Each deity requires the use of a specific call deity spell. (For example, call Ithaqua and call Hastur are two different spells). The specifics for each spell vary. Some are listed below.
    Azathoth: This spell can only be cast outdoors at night.
    Cthugha: The caster must be holding some sort of flame on a clear night outside, when Fomalhaut clears the horizon. (September to November are the best nights for Fomalhaut in North America.) Cthugha sometimes grants spells or temporary ability score points with which to east spells.
    Hastur: The caster(s) must arrange nine large blocks of stone in a V-pattern, each with a volume of at least 9 cubic yards. The spell can he cast only on clear nights when Aldebaran is above the horizon. (In North America, that's roughly between October and March.) Each byakhee present adds 10% to the chance that Hastur appears. Hastur sometimes grants spells.
    Ithaqua: The spell must he cast on an enormous mound of snow in the northern hemisphere, where the temperature is below freezing (or potentially on a snowy mountaintop anywhere). If appeased by the summoner, Ithaqua sometimes offers to destroy enemies, or grants spells.
    Nyogtha: The spell must be cast at the entrance to a cave that eventually connects to the cavern wherein Nyogtha dwells.
    Nyarlathotep: Each of this deity's avatars has its own spell and conditions for summoning.
    Shub-Niggurath: This spell must be cast before a consecrated stone altar in the dank wilderness during the dark of the moon. The altar is consecrated by bathing it in blood (20 HD of creatures worth). Each Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath present adds 10% to the chance that it will appear.
    Yog-Sothoth: This spell must be cast in a stone tower at least 30 feet high in an open area under a cloudless sky. Yog-Sothoth always takes a human victim when it appears. It will take a specific victim if presented with one.
    XP Cost: 5,000 XP.

    Candle Communication [Call of Cthulhu (pg 133)]
Transmutation
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Spellthief 3, Suel Arcanamach 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
    Two casters who know this spell must use it at the same time. The time is usually agreed upon long before the casting (such as every night at midnight). Once each casts the spell separately, they can both communicate verbally through a burning candle each has. If either candle flame is extinguished, the spell ends. The candles can be up to five miles per combined level of the casters apart (so two 5th-level casts can be fifty miles apart). This spell does not use the rules for multiple casters.
    Material Component: A candle for each caster.

    Cannibalize (Warcraft) [Warcraft (pg 159)]
Necromancy [Evil]
Level: Necromancer (Warcraft) 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: Concentration, up to 4 rounds
Range: Personal
Target: One corpse
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The caster gains some of the traits of a ghoul, especially the creature's bone-cracking jaw and extended tongue. The caster may consume flesh from a corpse to regain health.
    There is no saving throw because this spell works only on dead creatures and heals only the caster. The corpse must be mostly intact and must have a true anatomy (so gelatinous cubes are not allowed).
    By consuming the corpse's flesh, the caster regains 1d8 hit points per round of concentration, up to his normal maximum number of hit points. Once a corpse has been consumed, very little flesh remains and the corpse is no longer considered intact. A corpse can thus be the target of this spell only once.

    Carrion Swarm [Warcraft (pg 160)]
Conjuration (Summoning)
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Area: Cone
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A swarm of bats, poisonous spiders, flying beetles, and other such vermin extend out from the caster's hand to create a cone-shaped area of effect.
    This swarm of vermin causes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). The swarm's attacks are nonmagical. Creatures that are immune to poison take half damage (one quarter with a successful saving throw). Damage reduction or being incorporeal makes a creature immune to damage from carrion swarm.
    Material Component: A dead beetle, spider, or other vermin.

Target: One creature possessing another creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell forces a possessing creature, such as Y'golonac or a Yithian, out of its host. Add the creature's HD to its saving throw and subtract your level. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away. Lesser versions of this spell only affect one specific supernatural creature (thus, cast out devil, cast out Yithian, and cast out Y'golonac may be written as three different spells). This spell counters imprison mind.

    Cast Out Shan [Call of Cthulhu (pg 133)]

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One shan
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell forces a shan (an insect from Shaggai) to leave a victim or victims standing within a 5-foot-wide pentagram (usually drawn from the herb amica). The victim(s) and the caster have 1 point of Con drained permanently. After the ceremony, the pentagram is proof against a new shan intrusion for 12 hours. If performed in direct sunlight, any shan expelled is instantly slain.

Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Target: One primary target plus one secondary target/level (each must be within 30 feet of the primary target)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.
    The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) on the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as many dice of damage as the primary one did (rounded down). For example, a 19th level sorcerer generates a primary bolt (19d6 points of damage) and as many as 19 secondary bolts (each of which deals half as much damage as the primary bolt dealt). Each subject can attempt Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
    Focus: A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and one silver pin for each of your caster levels.

Each knot discharges into a randomly selected creature in the area and deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 5d4 points. A creature won't be hit by more than one bolt-extra bolts that randomly hit the same creature dissipate harmlessly instead. A Reflex save is allowed for half damage.

    Chilling Armor [Diablo 2 (pg 38)]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Effect: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text
    You surround yourself with an unstable field of subzero cold. Whenever you are struck in melee combat, the field fires an ice bolt at your attacker. The ice bolt deals 5d4 points of cold damage, and the attacker is allowed a Reflex save for half damage. Failure means the attacker also takes a -2 cold penalty to AC, melee attacks and damage, Reflex saves, and can jump only half as far as normal for 1 minute. The cold penalties are not cumulative-their duration is counted from the last failure.

Range: 0 ft.
Area: An emanation extending in a 20ft-radius around a 4ft-circle on the ground, with you in the center
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Magical energy bursts in all directions from the point of origin, subjecting everyone within the radius to excruciating pain (-2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks). Those successful in their saving throw must make a new saving throw each round in the area. The circle must be prepared ahead of time with an inscribed circle on the ground and four stones, one set at each cardinal direction. Creating this circle takes l hour. Anyone actually attempting to cross the circle must make a second saving throw; failure indicates the subject cannot take actions other than a single move action each round. Entering the 4-foot circle around the caster and succeeding at the saving throw to do so, ends the spell.
    Material Component: Four stones.

    Clay Golem [Diablo 2 (pg 38)]

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You raise a clay golem (see Chapter Five: Monsters). The golem attacks your enemies until ordered to cease, the duration ends, or the golem is slain. You can give the golem simple commands, including "guard" or "tote," if no immediate foes need to be fought. Unless it is in melee, the golem moves to remain within 30 feet of you. Cure spells and Healing potions have no effect on golems. If you summon any other creature before this spell ends, then this spell ends immediately.

    This spell causes the targets to become confused, making them unable to independently determine what they will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.
        d%  Behavior
        01-20   Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).
        11-20   Act normally.
        21-50   Do nothing but babble incoherently.
        51-70   Flee away from caster at top speed.
        71-100  Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self).
    A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
    Arcane Material Components: A set of three nut shells.

You must see the corpse (in the flesh, in a photo, and so on) to appear taller or shorter. thinner. fatter, or in between. The assumed form must be corporeal. Some Mythos creatures cast this spell while actually consuming their victims, but this is not necessary.

By changing to this new form, your body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs, and your weight can be changed up to one-half. If the form selected has wings, you can fly at a speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. If the form has gills. you can breathe underwater.

    Contact Creature [Call of Cthulhu (pg 135)]
Conjuration (Calling)
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, XP
Casting Time: 1d4+5 full rounds
Range: 50 miles/level
Target: 1 HD worth of creatures / level
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Many tomes have various contact creature spells. Each of these spells contacts a specific type of creature within range (if any) and entices it to come to the caster. (Thus, contact deep one and contact Formless Spawn are two different spells.) Multiple creatures are called if the caster's level is high enough to accommodate the creatures' Hit Dice. For example, a 6th-level caster using contact deep one can contact up to six deep ones. The creatures come under their own power, so ghouls have to walk, while flying polyps fly. The caster then never knows exactly when the creature will arrive. Outsider creatures appear magically 1d4 rounds after they are contacted.
    No sort of control of the creature, nor any guarantee it will not just leave once it arrives, is implied. Many creatures arrive angry, annoyed at the disturbance. You should have some means to appease the creature and some way to bargain with it to get it to do what you want.
    The specifics of these spells depend on the creature involved (more such spells are sure to exist for other creatures).
    Chthonian: This spell must be cast in an area frequented by earthquakes.
    Deep One: Contacting a deep one involves throwing specially inscribed tablets into the sea.
    Elder Thing: This spell should be cast in the southern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or near the geological trenches in Antarctica for any chance of success.
    Flying Polyp: Since these creatures live in underground cities, the caster should ensure there is a means (such as a shaft or tunnel) for these creatures to reach the surface.
    Formless Spawn: This spell should be cast either in a temple to Tsathoggua or near a cave connecting to the black abyss of N'Kai.
    Ghoul: This spell must he cast on a moonlit night near a graveyard or crypt.
    Gnoph-Keh: This spell must be cast in Greenland or near the North Pole to succeed. It also must be accompanied by a Perform (singing) check against DC 15 and an effigy made of ice and snow.
    Hound of Tindalos: This spell always succeeds, but there is no known way to bargain with these creatures.
    Mi-Go: This spell must he cast at the top of a high mountain in an area known to be frequented by the creatures (or, at least in theory, on Yuggoth itself).
    Rat-Thing: If a caster hopes to succeed, he should discover where these things exist, such as specific estates in Yorkshire, England or Arkham, Massachusetts.
    Sand-Dweller: This spell must be cast in a desert.
    Star-Spawn of Cthulhu: This spell must he cast along a coastline or under the water for it to succeed.
    XP Cost: 100 XP.

    Contact Deity [Call of Cthulhu (pg 135)]
Conjuration [Evil]

Casting Time: 1d4+5 full rounds
Range: Unlimited
Target: One deity
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    These spells are primarily cast by the truly mad, although attempting a contact deity spell is generally safer than actually calling the deity to come forth. A spell of this sort can be used to get the deity to do something for the caster or find out what the deity wishes of the caster. Each of these spells contacts a specific Elder God, Great Old One, or Outer God and entices it to come to the caster (in some form other than its physical form, if any). A 50% chance. +1 % per level of the caster(s), exists that the deity will heed the call. (If more than one caster is involved, add up the total levels of all casters and add it to 50%.) The manifestation of the deity appears magically 1d4 hours after it is contacted.
    The deity is never actually controlled by the caster, but initially, the deity is at least neutral to the caster. The deity is unlikely to give non-worshipers anything of value. If the caster bores the deity-perhaps simply by doing or offering nothing the deity can notice-the deity kills the caster or drives him insane. If you choose to cast this spell, you should have some means to appease the deity and some way to bargain with it to get it to do what you want. The specifics of these spells depend on the creature involved (more such spells are sure to exist for other deities).
    Chaugnar Faugn: lf the spell is successful, the deity sends dreams and nightmares to communicate with the caster.
    Cthulhu: If the spell is successful, the deity sends drums and nightmares to communicate with the caster.
    Eihort: If the spell is successful, the deity sends dreams and nightmares to communicate with the caster. it is willing to impart spells directly into the caster at the cost of an additional Wisdom point (permanently drained).
    Nyarlathotep: Although the spell can be cast anywhere, Nyarlathotep only communicates with those in a temple that has been properly dedicated to one of his forms. He appears as one of his many avatars (or "masks") according to his whim.
    Tsathoggua: If the spell is successful, this deity appears in a translucent version of its physical form (Sanity costs apply) and speaks verbally, but only when the caster is alone.
    Y'golonac: If the spell is successful, this deity possesses a friend or acquaintance of the caster and communicates through him. Y'golonac only speaks with worshipers. If the caster refuses to become the deity's priest, he is destroyed.
    Material Component: 0
    XP Cost: 5,000 XP.

    Only non-humans cast this spell (m-go employ it, for example).

The symbol can be drawn as a part of the spell-using chalk, scratches on wood or metal, or lines in dust-but since such attempts arc very easy to destiny (even accidentally), the sign is usually made ahead of time as a leaden seal, etched in rock or forged in steel, and then affixed to some permanent edifice. This spell can activate any elder sign whether it was created by the caster or not. An elder sign, while a potent symbol, cannot be used for personal protection or as a means to ward off a creature when carried around, such as a cross in at vampire movie.

    You create a nexus of magic and health, which hovers overhead in the form of a small golden globe. While the energy shield lasts, you can convert any uncast spell directly to hit points to negate damage the instant the damage is taken. You can't use this spell to heal damage in any other way. Uncast spells absorb 6 points of damage per level of the spell converted. A 2nd-level spell can absorb up to 12 points, a 3rd-level spell can absorb up to 18 points, and so on.
    The caster can convert more than one spell to absorb incoming damage in the same round, or just enough to partially absorb incoming damage. If a converted spell provides more hit points than necessary to absorb damage, it remaining points are carried forward against future damage. Converted spells are lost as if cast.
    Energy shield lapses whenever the caster sleeps or rests to prepare spells. Any healing unused when the spell ends is lost.

Spell Resistance: Yes
    A fireball spell is a burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
    You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
    The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
    Material Component: A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

Conjuration (Creation) [Force]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Warcraft) 0, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, F, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    A nearly invisible field of force surrounds the subject of frost armor. The temperature is noticeably chillier around the subject.
    Frost armor provides a +4 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, frost armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since frost armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
    Any creature striking the character with its body or with handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker becomes chilled. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to the chilling effect. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as two-handed spears, do not endanger their users in this way.
    A chilled creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate for 1 round. Chilled creatures can take only a move action or standard action on their next turn, but not both (nor may they take full-round actions). Additionally, they suffer a -2 penalty to AC, melee attack and damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Chilled creatures jump half as far as normal.
    Focus: A small piece of forged steel or a shaman's totem.

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half

    An icy version of nova, this spell creates a ring of freezing vapors that forms 10 feet away from you in all directions and blasts outward to a radius of 20 feet. Each creature within the affected area takes 1d4+1 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d4+5). A Reflex save reduces this damage to half, but those taking any frost nova damage must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed with cold and helpless for 1d3 rounds.

    A frost nova spell is a burst of ice and cold that detonates with a high-pitched shriek.
    Frost nova deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area of effect; a successful Reflex save halves the damage. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creatures almost no pressure.
    A frozen, pea-sized bead streaks from the caster's finger and, unless it hits a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, shatters into the frost nova at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage such as an arrow slit, the caster must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
    Creatures that take damage from the frost nova must succeed at a Fortitude save or be chilled for 1d4 rounds. A chilled creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate for 1 round. Chilled creatures can take only a move action or standard action on their next turn, but not both (nor may they take full-round actions). Additionally, they suffer a -2 penalty to AC, melee attack and damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Chilled creatures jump half as far as normal.
    Material Component: A few drops of water and a piece of glass, which must be shattered as the spell is cast.

    You surround yourself with a field of icy cold, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to your AC, chilling foes that strike you. Whenever you are hit in melee combat, the creature that struck you must make a Fortitude save. Failure means the attacker also takes a -2 cold penalty to AC, melee attacks and damage, Reflex saves, and can jump only half as far as normal for 1 minute. The cold penalties are not cumulative-their duration is counted from the last failure.

A Reflex save is allowed for half damage. Those who fail also take a -2 cold penalty to AC, melee attacks and damage, Reflex saves, and can jump only half as far as normal for 1 minute. The sphere cannot change direction or pass through solid objects.

Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
    You and whatever you are wearing or carrying vanishes from sight. You become invisible.
    Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can disappear (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
    You are not automatically silent while invisible. In some cases, an investigator using hide from the eye may need to make a Move Silently cheek to remain undetected. Certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable, such as stepping in a puddle. The spell ends if the subject speaks, causes a loud sound (such as firing a gun or knocking over a garbage can), directly touches another living creature, or is touched by a living creature. Throwing a small rock at a creature does not end the spell, but touching a creature with a baseball bat would.

    The fire bolts deal 5d4 points of fire damage each. The fireball is a 20-foot diameter area and deals 10d6 points of fire damage. A Reflex save is allowed against either effect for half damage. The caster need not concentrate on the hydra. If no foes are in range, the hydra holds its fire, though it vanishes after the spell's duration elapses: at this time, the heads sink back into the earth.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: 30 ft.
Effect: One iron golem
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You raise an iron golem (see Chapter Five: Monsters). The spell requires a permanent magic item for the golem to form around. This gives the golem, in addition to its normal abilities, the properties of the item (that is, the benefits of the item's prefix and suffix).
    The golem attacks your enemies until ordered to cease, the duration ends, or the golem is slain. You can give the golem simple commands, including "guard" or "tote," if no immediate foes need be fought. Unless it is in melee, the golem moves to remain within 30 feet of you. No known magic restores damage to a summoned golem. When the spell ends, the magic item can be easily picked up out of its dust. Cure spells and Healing potions have no effect on golems. If you summon any creature before this spell ends, then this spell ends immediately.
    Example: A necromancer uses an Oracular Longsword of the Lion to summon an iron golem. The iron golem is able to see invisible creatures, and has +18 hit points. Note that items with effects that do not apply to the golem give no benefit. (A Spider's Longsword of Greed does not grant the iron golem any spell levels, or help it find treasure.)
    Material Component: A permanent magic item.

    After an hour of chanting. You hurl one willing participant into the future. The destination is determined by the caster, but the margin of error is +/- 1d10 years. If this results in a trip to the past, the subject winks out of existence until he catches up with the present (but appears to have gone nowhere to non-time-traveling viewers and is not aware of what happened). The trip is a one-way affair.
    If this spell results in a time paradox, the subject must make a Will saving throw (DC 25-higher if the paradox is great, up to the discretion of the GM) or be driven completely mad (Sanity down to -10) or utterly destroyed (GM's discretion).
    Nyarlathotep has been known to occasionally impart this spell to his worshipers.

Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A ray of magical energy leaps toward the target, leeching from it the energy necessary to cast one or more spells.
    The caster must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the target loses 1d4+1 spell levels or spell slots, starting with hits highest levels. If the victim runs out of higher-level spells to drain, then two 0-level spells can be drained instead one 1st-level spell. If the victim runs out of slots than can be drained with a given roll, then there is no further effect.
    For example, a 3rd-level caster causes the loss of 1d4+l spell levels. On a roll of 3, the caster would cause 4 spell levels to be lost. If the victim has a 4th-level spell remaining, then it is lost. If the victim has no 4th-level spells, then one 3rd-level and one 1st-level spell are lost. If the victim has only 2nd-level spells remaining, two are lost. If the victim has only a 1st-level spell left, that spell is lost and the extra 3 spells levels of the effect are wasted.

You cannot compel the listeners to direct action, but you can influence how they feel about an action, or potentially keep them from an action. For example, you cannot force the listeners to go up to the old house on the hill and burn it down, but you can convince them that it was acceptable that you did it and that they shouldn't alert the police. (At the GM's discretion, this may automatically shift their reactions "less hostile" by one or two columns on the Attitude Adjustment table, page 226.) You must make a Diplomacy check (DC 18) to keep the subjects listening for the full 10 minutes of casting time.

If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature with too many HD. You must sing to initially charm the subjects. If they cannot hear you, they are immune to the spell. After the spell has been cast, you do not need to sing to communicate further suggestions.
    The spell does not enable you to control these subjects as if they were automatons, but they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subjects orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma cheek to convince a subject to do anything he wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed.) The subject never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but he might believe you if you assured him that the only chance to save your life is for him to hold back an onrushing shoggoth for "just a few seconds." Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the subject of this spell breaks the spell. Note also that you must speak the person's language to communicate your commands; otherwise, you can only communicate in gestures.

Thus, if you drain 1 point of Strength, you must choose another score the next round to drain. and cannot choose Strength again until you have drained one point of Con. Dex, Int, Wis, and Cha. Then you can drain another point of Strength, but not a third until you have drained a second point from all the others.
    If cast on the night of a full moon, for each point you drain, you become effectively one week younger. If east at other times, the subject suffers the drains, but you gain nothing.

Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell summons a greater or lesser servitor, or even an independent race (if it was once a servitor race). It appears where you designate and acts immediately. If you wish, you can attempt to bind it and give it a specific command of limited duration (something that can be accomplished within the duration). "Protect me forever" would not work, but "slay the man in the corner" would.
    At the conclusion of a summon spell, the creature can attempt a Will save. If the check succeeds, the spell is negated. If the summoning succeeds, but the caster does not attempt a binding, the creature remains for the duration doing whatever is appropriate for the creature. (Attacking those around it might be appropriate, but it has no special need to choose to attack the caster over other potential targets.)
    At the conclusion of a bind spell, the caster and the creature make opposed Wisdom checks. If the caster gets a higher result on his Wisdom check, the creature has been bound. If the creature gets a higher result on its Wisdom cheek. it attacks the caster and leaves at the end of the duration of the spell.
    The caster can attempt to bind a creature that he did not summon himself if he knows the proper bind spell. In this ease. the bound creature obeys the caster's command (as described above), but after the duration is over, it can go back to whatever it was doing before.
    Each spell to summon a specific creature is a different spell, and each spell to hind a creature is a different spell. (For instance, summon byakhee, bind byakhee, and summon Dark Young are three different spells.) Authors of occult tomes don't always know how to bind the creatures they summon.
    Byakhee: A whistle must be blown during the summoning. The spell is only useful on nights when Aldebaran is above the horizon (October through March in North America). The summoned by byakhee floats down out of the icy. star-filled night sky.
    Dark Young: A Small or larger creature must he sacrificed with a knife as a part of the spell. The spell must be east outdoors during a new moon in the woods. The Dark Young appears out of the shadows of the trees.
    Dimensional Shambler: This spell requires a dagger made of any pure metal, such as copper or iron. The shambler appears out of empty space.
    Fire Vampire: A bonfire or other source of flame is required to cast this spell. The spell may be cast only at night when the star Fomalhaut is above the horizon (September through November in North America). Tie fire vampire appears from out of the sky, as if a star has suddenly fallen from the heavens.
    Hunting Horror: This spell must he east at night in the open air. A sacrifice of a sentient creature must be offered to the hunting horror, who devours it when it arrives (in 1 round). The horror appears headfirst, as though pushing its way through at hole in the air.
    Nightgaunt: To cast this spell, you need to use a stone emblazoned with an elder sign at night when there is no moon. The nightgaunt appears out of the darkness on silent wings.
    Servitor of the Outer Gods: A flute must he played atonally during the casting of this spell. Amid echoes of more piping from afar. the servitor appears.
    Star Vampire: This spell must be cast at night under a cloudless sky. The star vampire descends from the stars, but it is invisible (even to the caster) until it feeds.
    XP Cost: 1,000 XP.

    Touch of Life [Warcraft (pg 170)]
Conjuration (Healing)
Level: Healer (Warcraft) 9
Components: V, S, M, DF
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Touch
Target: Dead creature touched
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    The caster temporarily restores life to a deceased creature.
    The caster can raise creatures who have been dead only up to 1 round per caster level. In addition. the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return. the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw.
    Upon completing of the spell. the creature is immediately restored to full hit points. vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution point) or prepared spells. Normal poisons and normal diseases are cured in the process of raising the subject. but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the quell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. The dead creature's equipment or possessions are untouched by this spell.
    The caster can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then killed again (essentially, an inanimate body). Constructs. elementals. outsiders. and (animated) undead creatures cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.
    When the spell expires. the subject immediately drops dead as though it had never been raised.
    The original death of the creature is used to determine the time limit for casting this spell. For example, if a 17th-level caster raises a creature on the round after that creature died and the creature is slain again 5 rounds later, the 17th-level caster could cast touch of life again any time within the next 12 rounds. If the creature survived to the end of the spell's normal duration (17 rounds in this case), then the 17th-level caster could not cast the spell again because it is now beyond the time limit of the corpse.
    Casting this spell does not affect in any way the ability of another caster to use raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection to restore permanent life to the subject.
    Material Component: Diamonds worth a total of at least 5,000 gp.

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    The caster grants the target the untiring stamina and energy of the undead.
    The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. When making a full attack action, the creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by haste or a weapon of speed; nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you cannot use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)
    There is a price for the stress this spell places on the creature's physiology, however. The subject suffers 1d4 points of damage each round.
    Unholy frenzy is countered and dispelled by slow.

Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
    You immediately fall into a deep sleep; your spirit then becomes ethereal. Your physical hotly remains helpless, but your spirit can wander through the physical world.
    An ethereal spirit is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or clown (albeit at half normal speed). Since you are incorporeal, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. However, an ethereal spirit can't attack material creatures.
    Your spirit can see and hear physical and material objects, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing in the material world are limited to 60 feet and limited by existing conditions (if it's dark, you can't see). Spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. By contrast, treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they had become material.
    When the spell ends, you return to your body. although you do not awaken for 12 hours-a sleep that does not allow you to regain lost hit points or ability score damage.
