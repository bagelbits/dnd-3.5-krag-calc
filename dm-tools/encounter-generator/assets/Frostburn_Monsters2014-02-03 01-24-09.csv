The top of its head is a massive ridge of bone, ending in two parallel nose-horns. Its neck and shoulders are corded with muscle. Brantas are fleet-footed herbivores preyed upon by many frostfell creatures. Surefooted and sturdy, they bolt when they sense danger. No one has succeeded in domesticating brantas, but both orcs and dragons have walled in branta herds by blocking off mountain valleys to trap them. Branta flesh is a tight, light-hued, nourishing meat. Found wandering in all but the rockiest or most dense forest terrain, brantas prefer to munch on high vegetation, where their raised heads can survey their surroundings. 
COMBAT Brantas spring into flight at any sign of approaching peril, but if they see no clear route of escape, they rear, skid into a tight turn, and lower their heads to charge.","
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the branta must hit a Medium or smaller foe with a gore attack. If it gets a hold, it tosses its opponent. 
Toss (Ex): Brantas vigorously shake any creature caught in their horns and fling it in a random direction. Resolve the toss as a bull rush maneuver (+8 check modifier), except that there is no attack of opportunity, since the branta has already grabbed its foe when it tries to toss the victim. The branta does not need to move with its foe in order to throw its foe more than 5 feet. If the tossed victim beats the branta's Strength check, he remains in his current square with no ill effects and is not grappled any longer. Tossed victims take impact damage on landing as if they had fallen a distance equal to the distance they were tossed. 
Scent (Ex): A branta can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. 
Surefooted (Ex): Brantas ignore all movement penalties associated with snow on the ground. They also receive a +4 racial bonus on Balance checks when walking on ice or snow.",Books: Frostburn

Its body is saucer-shaped, with a long, powerful tail ending in a macelike club and huge jutting ribs of bone arching over its back. Its head is vaguely insectile and shelters between its forelimbs, protected by its bony carapace. Four long clawed arms sprout from its back, ending in claws that look like razor-sharp icicles. Chilblains originate on the Material Plane, but seem more like inhabitants of the most frigid regions of the Elemental Planes. These strange creatures have an innate hatred of warmth and seek to destroy all life not affiliated with cold energy-especially creatures of fire, their sworn enemies. Though chilblains are well-suited for life in frostfell environments, they often mount solitary raids into warmer lands, wreaking havoc on whatever they encounter. In their relentless pursuit of destruction, they fight to the death, never seeing beyond the present battle, seeking only to quench their ever-burning urge to smite the warm.

Cold Aura (Ex): A chilblain radiates intense cold in a 10- foot radius. Any creature within 10 feet of the chilblain takes 2d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of its turn.

Skills: A dire polar bear has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.

A tail ending in a heavy spiked club of bone trails behind its dome-shaped body. Glyptodon (literally, ""carved tooth"") is an enormous armadillo like creature-if an armadillo were the size of a small wagon. It has a short snout and powerful jaws, with no teeth in the front of the mouth, but grinding teeth farther back in the mouth. While it is a plant-eater, its armor plating and heavy knobbed tail makes it very capable of defending itself against smaller predators and even of chasing off other grazers. Glyptodons are especially hostile to horses, musk oxen, and other arctic and subarctic herbivores that compete with them for the rich summer grasses. Glyptodons are often prey for sabertoothed tigers, dire lions, and other deadly hunters such as dragons and humans. A fully grown glyptodon is about 10 feet long and 5 feet tall, and weighs about 3,000 to 4,500 pounds. 
COMBAT A glyptodon found by itself is common, but the creatures also fight in small groups, circling around the young to create a wall of armored flesh. If provoked, a glyptodon typically begins a combat by attempting to trample its foe.","
Augmented Critical (Ex): A glyptodon deals triple damage if it scores a critical hit with its tail attack. 
Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a glyptodon can move up to twice its speed and literally run over Medium or smaller creatures. This attack deals 1d6+7 points of damage. Trampled opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the glyptodon at a -4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Strength-based. Training a Glyptodon Small and Medium humanoids such as neanderthals, goblinoids, and orcs sometimes use glyptodons as mounts or pack animals. They are particularly useful as archery platforms on a battlefield, as their gait is slow and steady. Training a glyptodon requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a glyptodon requires an exotic saddle that includes a prod that a glyptodon can feel through its armor. A glyptodon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. 
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a glyptodon is up to 400 pounds; a medium load, 401-800 pounds; and a heavy load, 801-1,200 pounds. A glyptodon can drag 6,000 pounds.",Books: Frostburn

The megaloceros is a large, powerful deer, standing up to 7 feet tall at the shoulder with 100-pound antlers spanning 12 feet. It favors lakes and bogs, and can be trained to serve as a mount. The creatures' enormous antlered skulls are popular decorations for castles and hunting lodges. These beasts also serve as powerful totem animals for neanderthals and snow goblins, who call the animals ""Great Snow Elk."" 
COMBAT Megaloceroses prefer to avoid combat, except during mating season, when males are extremely aggressive and territorial, and during the spring calving season, when female megaloceroses are extremely aggressive in defense of their young. Megaloceroses typically charge the most obvious or brightly colored target, attempting to gore and toss it, then return to trample and finish it. When an entire herd is threatened, the young males sometimes charge two and three together against a threat.","
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the creature must hit a Medium or smaller opponent with its gore attack. If it gets a hold, the megaloceros scoops up the opponent with its antlers and can toss it aside. 
Stampede (Ex): A frightened herd of megaloceroses may flee as a group in a random direction (but always away from the perceived source of danger). They literally run over anything of Large or smaller size that gets in their way, dealing 1d12 points of damage for each five megaloceroses in the herd (DC 18 Reflex save half). 
Toss (Ex): A megaloceros can vigorously shake any creature caught in its horns and fling it in a random direction. Resolve the toss as a bull rush maneuver (+9 check modifier), except that there is no attack of opportunity, since the megaloceros has already grabbed its foe when it tries to toss the victim. The megaloceros does not need to move with its foe in order to throw its foe more than 5 feet.

Scent (Ex): A megaloceros can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. Training a Megaloceros Small and Medium humanoids such as neanderthals, snow elves, human druids, and gnomes sometimes use megaloceroses as mounts; Midgard dwarves use them as pack animals. Their speed and height are particularly useful for scouts and reconnaissance of all kinds. Their gait is fast, jarring, and prone to sudden shifts in direction. Training a megaloceros requires four weeks and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. Riding a megaloceros requires an exotic saddle. A megaloceros can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Twice as large as a lion, skilled in deadly hunting tactics, and equipped with murderous fangs, the smilodon (or saber-toothed tiger) is the lord of icy plains and hills. The saber-toothed tiger is not actually closely related to other tigers. A smilodon is more than 8 feet long and weighs more than 800 pounds. The pride is ruled by the female saber-tooths, though sometimes two or even three males are tolerated. The creatures' favored prey are herbivores such as branta, mammoths, glyptodons, horses, and megaloceroses. Although they work together, fights over dominance, food, territory and mates are common, and sometimes even lethal. A saber-toothed tiger's roar is louder than a lion's. Weaker saber-tooths are often driven out of the pride in pairs, after which they set up hunting territories in forests or hills. They use caves or small earthen dens for bearing litters and rearing their young. 
COMBAT The saber-toothed tiger is a canny hunter, rarely greedy but with a large enough appetite to require frequent kills. Sabertoothed tigers do not chase down prey over long distances. Instead, they leap or charge from ambush, waiting for prey to come close before attacking. Groups of saber-toothed tigers work together much like lions and other social hunting cats; one group will startle prey, sending it running directly into a second group of tigers. They sometimes ignore motionless prey.","
Augmented Critical (Ex): A saber-toothed tiger deals triple damage if it scores a critical hit with its bite attack. 
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the sabertoothed tiger must hit with a bite or a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake. 
Pounce (Ex): If a saber-toothed tiger charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks. 
Rake (Ex): A saber-toothed tiger gains two additional claw attacks against grappled foes or foes it pounces on (attack bonus +10, damage 1d6+3). Rake attacks are not subject to the normal -4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple. 
Scent (Ex): A saber-toothed tiger can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. 
Skills: Saber-toothed tigers gain a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In forest terrain, their Hide bonus improves to +8.",Books: Frostburn

Woolly mammoths are members of a family of many elephantlike species; all are enormous, furred animals with surprising intelligence, large tusks, and a love of cold climates. The largest woolly mammoths live on the open steppes, where their sheer size protects them from most predators. The only exceptions are intelligent humanoids, such as humans, neanderthals, and orcs-and even these are often reluctant to face down a woolly mammoth directly. The woolly mammoth has a shoulder height of about 15 feet, weighs between 9 and 11 tons, and has tusks roughly 15 feet long. It lives in large family groups on open steppe. All woolly mammoth herds are led by the eldest female woolly mammoth, her sisters, and her daughters. Male woolly mammoths are the fighters but not the dominant animals in woolly mammoth herds. Woolly mammoths often venerate the bones of their dead, and after any combat they return to the site of a herd member's death. In some cases, the woolly mammoths handle the bones of the dead years after the death of a mate, sibling, or child. Frost folk and others believe that this is how woolly mammoths communicate with the dead, and that woolly mammoth spirits and totems have great power in the land of the dead. 
COMBAT Woolly mammoths are usually aggressive only when stalked or threatened or when they fear for the safety of their young. Like elephants, woolly mammoths have long memories, and will take revenge on creatures that harmed them in the past. Woolly mammoths prefer to fight as a herd rather than individually, though the lead bull in a herd (usually a male with advanced Hit Dice) will often fight alone to defend the females and young.","
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a woolly mammoth must hit a Large or smaller foe with a gore attack. If it gets a hold, it tosses its opponent. 
Toss (Ex): Woolly mammoths vigorously shake any creature caught in their tusks and fling it in a random direction. Resolve the toss as a bull rush maneuver (+20 check modifi er), except that there is no attack of opportunity, since the woolly mammoth has already grabbed its foe when it tries to toss the victim. The woolly mammoth does not need to move with its foe in order to throw its foe more than 5 feet. If the tossed victim beats the woolly mammoth's bull rush check, he remains in his current square with no ill effects and is not grappled any longer. Tossed victims take impact damage on landing as if they had fallen a distance equal to the distance they were tossed.

Trampled opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the woolly mammoth at a -4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt DC 29 Reflex saves for half damage. The save DC is Strength-based. 
Scent (Ex): A woolly mammoth can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. Training a Woolly Mammoth Giants and humanoids such as frost folk, humans, and ogres sometimes use woolly mammoths as mounts or pack animals. Training a woolly mammoth must begin with a young animal; adults rarely cooperate and will starve themselves rather than submit to training. Training a young woolly mammoth requires six weeks and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a woolly mammoth requires an exotic saddle or howdah, which includes a prod that the animal can feel through its fur and its thick hide. A woolly mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack except with a lance or a missile weapon. 
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a woolly mammoth is up to 5,592 pounds; a medium load, 5,593-11,184 pounds; and a heavy load, 11,185-16,776 pounds. A woolly mammoth can drag 40 tons.",Books: Frostburn

Its sleek, serpentine body glistens black, yet its tail and head are undoubtedly whalelike in appearance . . . with the possible exception of those large sharp teeth. Zeuglodons are massive, almost serpentlike whales that lurk in the coldest oceans. They are a uniform dark gray or black in color. Their heads are long and narrow, with numerous serrated teeth in the jaws. Unlike most other whales, their bodies are quite thin and almost serpentine in shape. They possess two pairs of flippers; the front pair is large and well developed, but the back pair is atrophied nearly to the point of uselessness. A little more than half of a zeuglodon's body is taken up by its long and powerful tail. The massive flukes of a zeuglodon's tail can smash even the hardiest ship to splinters in a short time. Zeuglodons up to 75 feet long have been sighted by reputable sailors, but stories abound of massive zeuglodons measuring well over 120 feet in length. It's likely that most people unfortunate enough to encounter such a creature didn't survive to tell the tale. 
COMBAT Sailors rightly fear these mighty creatures, for unlike most other whales, zeuglodons are foul-tempered and highly territorial. They are quick to attack anything that intrudes too closely to their territory, and ships avoid waters known to be inhabited by zeuglodons. Although its jaws are filled with massive sharp teeth, a zeuglodon's most dangerous weapon is its tail. These creatures are surprisingly swift and adroit in water, and can slam enemies with their tail with devastating accuracy.","
Stunning Strike (Ex): Any creature struck with a critical hit by a zeuglodon's tail slam must make a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 2d4 rounds by the force of the blow. The save DC is Strength-based. 
Blindsight (Ex): Zeuglodons can ""see"" by emitting highfrequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces the creature to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's. 
Hold Breath (Ex): A zeuglodon can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 X its Constitution score before it risks drowning. 
Skills: A zeuglodon has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A zeuglodon has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks.

The domovoi is a nocturnal house spirit, a protector of creatures that depend on hearth and fire to live in cold areas. While a domovoi (or just as often, a whole family of them) watches over an encampment, village, or town, the buildings are brighter lit, the hearth fires are warmer, and creatures of cold and night are less likely to strike. For all these reasons, they are found in association with humans, neanderthals, dwarves, gnomes, kobolds, orcs, and even ogres and giants. When winter camps are abandoned by nomadic hunters, the domovoi maintain them as their own until the hunters return. A typical domovoi is a 2-foot-tall human-shaped creature with a dark, sooty skin and hairy arms, a thick beard, and furry legs, chest, and back. Domovoi typically wear rags cast off by the creatures whose houses they share. They eat small quantities of firewood and grain (offerings) as well as rats and mice they catch for themselves. Domovoi speak Common, Sylvan, Ignan, and the language of their hosts. 
COMBAT Domovoi are not eager fighters, but when driven away from their beloved fires they can grow sulky and even violent. They prefer to fight with magical manipulation of fire and smoke rather than with their rather weak claws. A domovoi typically attacks with its produce f lame spell-like ability. Domovoi never burn down the house of a host; if anything, they quench fires whenever possible.","

It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether or not a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

He carries a battleaxe thrust through his broad leather belt, and his hair and beard are white. Midgard dwarves are a powerful, semimythical race capable of forging priceless magical treasures and even artifacts. Their magical ability is limited to crafting items, but they are also skilled warriors, capable of defeating giants and heroes alike. Unlike most other dwarves, they are relatively solitary, living in small groups of no more than 30 individuals. Midgard dwarves stand about 3-1/2 feet high, with large heads and big hands. Their shoulders are broad and their arms stout-the result of wielding hammers and tongs over anvils and fires for decades. They craft masterwork items almost as a matter of course. In winter, they work tirelessly in homes below the earth; in summer, they farm the surface, or travel to trade their gold, silver, and steel for food and cloth from humans, trolls, elves, and others. Midgard dwarves are responsible for the manufacture of a number of divine items and artifacts, such as Thor's hammer, Sif's golden hair, Sigfried's magical ring, and the chain that bound Fenris, the divine wolf that will destroy the world. Their hoards of gold sometimes rival those of small dragons, and they compete with dragons for gold. of the Norse deities, and indeed of deities and priests in general, for good reason. Many Midgard dwarves, such as Andvari, have been killed or robbed by the Aesir. Midgard dwarves speak Dwarven and Celestial. 
COMBAT The dwarves have traditionally been for the dwarves, unwilling to fight for any cause except their own. That said, in Norse legends and sagas, dwarves were willing to fight the gods themselves if necessary. This stubbornness serves them well, as do their magic weapons, rings, and armor.","
Curse (Su): Once per year as a standard action, a Midgard dwarf can lay a powerful curse on someone who has wronged him (usually by stealing from him, injuring him, or killing a close relation). This functions like bestow curse (DC 16, CL 20th), except that the range is unlimited, and the spell is dismissible. The save DC is Wisdom-based. The dwarf must be able to see or describe his target (for example, ""the thief who took my gold, wherever he is"" or ""the one who killed Snorri"") and the target must be guilty of the injury the dwarf specifies. Dwarves on the brink of falling in battle have been known to forego an attack in order to curse the enemy who is about to defeat them. A dwarf can sometimes be persuaded to lift his curse with an offer of weregild-money to compensate the dwarf for the injury or wrong he suffered. Generally, this requires at least 1,000 gold pieces. 
Alternate Form (Su): Midgard dwarves have the ability to assume the form of one specific animal of Small or smaller size-typically a badger, otter, raven, or weasel. A Midgard dwarf can shift between its humanoid and animal form as a standard action. This ability works much like the polymorph spell, except that the Midgard dwarf is limited to the one specific animal he knows how to turn into, and he does not regain hit points for changing form. Dwarven Blood: For all effects related to race, a Midgard dwarf is considered a dwarf. Magic Items: All Midgard dwarves equip themselves with magic arms and armor. The dwarf described here uses a +2 chain shirt, +2 battleaxe, +1 light crossbow, and +1 ring of protection, but other dwarves may have different possessions. Few seek to take their wealth from Midgard dwarves, since they are notoriously unforgiving. Midgard dwarves will carry a grudge or grievance for generations, even passing it down in clan and family lines. 
Master Smith (Ex): Midgard dwarves gain Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, and Forge Ring as bonus feats. They are considered to possess the prerequisites necessary to craft any magic item of those types, even if they do not otherwise meet the requirements or have the ability to cast the necessary spells. 
Native Outsider Traits: Unlike most outsiders, Mid gard dwarves can be raised or resurrected normally. They have darkvision out to 60 feet. 
Skills: Midgard dwarves have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks, and a +4 racial bonus on Use Magic Device checks.

Her eyes glow with white fire and misty vapors pour off her body, evaporating into the air. Below her torso, her body becomes a shifting column of ice blocks that connect her to the icy surface beneath her. Owing to their rigid structure and their constant fear of melting, ice weirds have become predictors of the unending battle between chaos and law. They foresee which of these primal forces will dominate future events. An ice weird's lair is usually situated within a glacier, iceberg, or surprisingly often within special chambers filled with freezing cold created by wizards of chaos or law who wish to take advantage of the ice weird's prognostications. Ice weirds speak Aquan, Auran, Common, and Ice Weird. They also benefit from their tongues spell-like ability. Weirds are strange beings of elemental energy who are mighty diviners. They are oracles and seers, sometimes sought out by mortal creatures for the gifts of knowledge they can offer. Weirds dwell in remote or hidden places in the Material Plane; the frostfell is home to two varieties, the ice weird and snow weird. A weird resembles a beautiful female humanoid composed of snow or ice. The creature is bound to a special elemental pool, a place of power from which the mystic energies that comprise the weird spring. Like most seers, weirds rarely provide clear prophecies or prognostications. Weirds do not lie, but they often omit information, or provide information the listener simply can't understand yet because the requisite events have not yet come to pass. Weirds do not dispense their prophecies for free-those who seek one out would be wise to bring gifts or offerings, or be prepared to serve the creature as it directs. A weird can communicate with any creature that has a language. 
COMBAT Weirds avoid combat, going so far as to abandon their pools and return to their native elemental planes rather than engage in a fight. If circumstances prevent them from simply avoiding battle, they use their formidable spells and special abilities to attack at range, viewing melee combat as a tactic of last resort. Elemental Pool: Weirds are physically tied to magic pools or patches of their native substance, and cannot leave except to return to their native plane, either the Elemental Plane of Air or Water. Each elemental pool has a portal to the elemental planes at its bottom. An elemental pool is always at least 40 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep, although a pool can be up to ten times that size. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its ice pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental pool. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special properties.","
Prescience (Sp): At will and as a free action, a weird can duplicate the effect of any of the following divination spells: clairaudience/clairvoyance, contact other plane, detect thoughts (DC 18), discern location, find the path, foresight, greater scrying (DC 23), legend lore, locate creature, locate object, tongues, vision. Caster level 18th. 
Searching Gaze (Su): A weird continually has the benefi ts of the analyze dweomer and true seeing spells. Ice weirds refrain from combat unless they or the elemental ice in which they dwell are attacked.  
Chill (Ex): In addition to its normal slam damage, an ice weird deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with a successful melee attack. 
Elemental Command (Su): An ice weird can attempt to gain control over any elemental with the cold or water subtype within 100 feet. The elemental must make a successful DC 23 Will save or succumb to the ice weird's control. An elemental that saves against this attack is immune to that weird's elemental command ability for 24 hours. A weird has no limit to the number of elementals it can control. The save DC is Charisma-based. Once under the weird's command, an elemental serves the ice weird until either it or the weird dies, until the weird dismisses it, or until the duration for its summoning expires. It obeys the ice weird explicitly, even if ordered to attack the being who originally summoned it. The weird does not need to concentrate to maintain control over any elemental it commands. 
Spells: An ice weird can cast arcane spells and divine spells from the Chaos, Cold, and Law domains as an 18thlevel sorcerer. 
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/8/8/7/7/7/7/6/5/3 per day): 0-arcane mark, daze (DC 16), detect magic, flare, ghost sound (DC 16), mage hand, ray of frost, read magic, resistance; 1st-magic missile, obscuring mist, shield, silent image, true strike; 2nd-calm emotions (DC 18), invisibility, mirror image, scorching ray (+12 ranged touch), whispering wind; 3rd-displacement, lightning bolt (DC 19), protection from energy, suggestion (DC 19); 4th-lesser geas (DC 20), remove curse, solid fog, wall of ice (DC 20); 5th-cone of cold (DC 21), dispel law (DC 21), dream, feeblemind (DC 21); 6th-animate objects, chain lightning (DC 22), greater dispel magic; 7th-dictum (DC 23), project image, spell turning; 8th-demand (DC 24), polar ray (+12 ranged touch); 9th-mass hold monster (DC 25). 
Summon Elementals (Sp): Three times per day, an ice weird can summon forth water elementals from its elemental ice pool. It can choose to summon 3 Huge, 2 greater, or 1 elder elemental through this portal. This functions like summon monster IX, caster level 20th. 
Elemental Ice Pool (Su): An ice weird dwells within a large patch or pool of churning, grinding elemental ice, anything from a frozen pool to an iceberg or even a glacier. Any nonelemental creature entering a weird's pool without the weird's permission must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or be irrevocably transformed into ice. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from cold and ice, as well as the means to breathe and move normally. Otherwise, they take 2d6 points of damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per round from the churning blocks of ice, and may drown. An ice weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane. 
Elemental Traits: An ice weird has immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. It cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish,miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life). It has darkvision out to 60 feet. 
Heat Sense (Su): An ice weird can automatically sense heat sources within 60 feet, as the spell detect fire. It senses only the presence or absence of heat, but if it chooses to use a standard action to concentrate on this ability, it can establish the number and location of heat auras and the strength of each in the second and third rounds of concentration. Invisible creatures whose location is pinpointed by heat sense still have total concealment from an ice weird. 
Ice Mastery (Ex): An ice weird gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching ice. 
Regeneration (Ex): An ice weird takes normal damage from fire and cold iron weapons. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage ignore regeneration. 
Skills: An ice weird has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.",Books: Frostburn

Searching Gaze (Su): A weird continually has the benefi ts of the analyze dweomer and true seeing spells. A snow weird refrains from combat unless it or the elemental snow in which it dwells is attacked.  
Chill (Ex): In addition to its normal slam damage, a snow weird deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with a successful melee attack. Elemental Command 
(Su): A snow weird can attempt to gain control over any elemental with the cold or air subtype within 100 feet. The elemental must make a successful DC 23 Will save or succumb to the snow weird's control. An elemental that saves against this attack is immune weird has no limit to the number of elementals it can control. The save DC is Charisma-based. Once under the weird's command, an elemental serves the snow weird until either it or the weird dies, until the weird dismisses it, or until the duration for its summoning expires. It obeys the snow weird explicitly, even if ordered to attack the being who originally summoned it. The weird does not need to concentrate to maintain control over any elemental it commands. 
Spells: A snow weird can cast arcane spells and divine spells from the Air and Cold domains as an 18th-level sorcerer. 
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/8/8/7/7/7/7/6/5/3 per day): 0-arcane mark, daze (DC 16), detect magic, flare, ghost sound (DC 16), mage hand, ray of frost (+14 ranged touch), read magic, resistance; 1st-magic missile, obscuring mist, shield, silent image (DC 17), true strike; 2nd-gust of wind (DC 18), invisibility, mirror image, misdirection (DC 18), whispering wind; 3rd-gaseous form, lightning bolt (DC 19), protection from energy, suggestion (DC 19); 4th-charm monster (DC 20), rainbow pattern (DC 20), solid fog, wall of ice (DC 20); 5th-cone of cold (DC 21), control winds, dream, waves of fatigue; 6th-geas/quest (DC 22), chain lightning (DC 22), greater dispel magic; 7th-control weather, power word blind (DC 23), spell turning; 8th-polar ray (+14 ranged touch), whirlwind (DC 24); 9th-time stop. 
Summon Elementals (Sp): Three times per day, a snow weird can summon forth air elementals from its elemental snow pool. It can choose to summon 3 Huge, 2 greater, or 1 elder elemental through this portal. This functions like summon monster IX, caster level 20th. 
Elemental Snow Pool (Su): A snow weird dwells within a large pool of swirling elemental snow. Any nonelemental creature entering a weird's pool without the weird's permission must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or be irrevocably transformed into snow. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from cold and snow, as well as the means to breathe and move normally. Otherwise, they take 4d6 points of cold damage per round. In addition, creatures may drown. 
Elemental Traits: A snow weird has immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. It cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life). It has darkvision out to 60 feet. 
Heat Sense (Su): A snow weird can automatically sense heat sources within 60 feet, as the spell detect fire. It senses only the presence or absence of heat, but if it chooses to use a standard action to concentrate on this ability, it can establish the number and location of heat auras and the strength of each in the second and third rounds of concentration. Invisible creatures whose location is pinpointed by heat sense still have total concealment from a snow weird. 
Regeneration (Ex): A snow weird takes normal damage from fire and cold iron weapons. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage ignore regeneration. 
Snow Mastery (Ex): A snow weird gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching snow.",Books: Frostburn

The huge mantle of icy armor makes this fearsome apparition the size of an ogre. The entombed are undead preserved by being encased in shells of ice-but still able to move and kill. Entombed are human or humanoid undead entirely frozen inside an icy sheath that gives them the stature of an ogre. The face of one of these creatures is usually frozen in a rictus of fear or sorrow-its flesh, hair, and eyes are always very well preserved, though the skin sometimes takes on a frozen whitish tone. Entombed do not speak, but are able to hear others through their icy coating. They understand Common. 
COMBAT Entombed are known for their ability to slide through ice, such as glaciers or icebergs. Notorious for surprising foes, an entombed will often silently burrow up to its enemies Entombed as they camp on the ice. Sometimes entombed attack from within ice-covered lakes; they often reach up through ice to attack targets on the surface, while they remain protected by the ice above them. Once it has attacked by surprise, an entombed then tries to drag its victims back under the ice.","
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by an entombed becomes an entombed in 1d4 rounds, provided it is encased in ice (see Immure, below). Spawn are under the command of the entombed that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. 
Freeze (Su): An entombed can drain the heat from a living creature. On a successful grapple check, the entombed deals 2d4 points of Dexterity damage to a grappled foe (Fortitude save DC 19 half ). This is a supernatural cold effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Icy Touch (Su): An entombed deals an additional 2d6 points of cold damage with each successful slam attack. On its turn, it deals 2d6 points of cold damage per round to any creature it grapples. 
Immure (Su): As a standard action, an entombed that begins its turn with a hold on its opponent can attempt to drag a grappled creature under the ice, trapping it in a layer of ice and eventually creating another one of its own kind. The entombed must win an opposed grapple check; if it succeeds, it can move up to half its speed, dragging its grappled foe with it. If it has pinned its foe, the entombed gets a +4 bonus on this check. If the entombed successfully drags its foe into solid ice, the victim is immediately immobilized and cannot move or take any actions other than purely mental ones. He may be subject to drowning (although he can hold his breath before he enters the ice). As a full-round action, an entombed victim within 5 feet of the ice's surface can attempt a DC 23 Strength check to break out. If he is more than 5 feet deep in the ice, a successful check does not free him, but gives him enough space to take physical actions that he could otherwise take while grappled, such as attempting to draw a light weapon, cast a spell, or attack the ice with a light weapon and try to carve his way out. An entombed often chooses to continue attacking a victim immured in the ice, since the ice does not prevent its own movement or attacks. 
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an entombed must hit a Large or smaller opponent with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, deals damage with its icy touch, and immediately uses its freeze ability. In subsequent rounds it continues to deal damage with its icy touch and can freeze again, or attempt to use its immure ability. 
Ice Glide (Ex): An entombed can glide through ice, snow, or slush as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and its passage does not create any ripples or other signs of its presence. An entombed often fights from the cover of an ice sheet or snow field in much the same way that an incorporeal creature can use a wall or floor for cover. An entombed attacking a creature outside the ice or snow in which it is hiding gains the benefit of cover. 
Tremorsense (Ex): An entombed can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground (or ice or snow on top of the ground). 
Undead Traits: An entombed is immune to mindaffecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.",Books: Frostburn

He wears studded leather armor and carries a battleaxe. Frost folk are an isolated and xenophobic race descended from humans who struck a bargain with the gods of winter. In exchange for power over snow and ice, they sold their souls to a cruel deity-or, as some claim, an archdevil. Frost folk are almost always encountered alone, a single frost man sometimes accompanied by a hunting winter wolf. They are of the height and weight of a typical human male, with bright blue eyes, and pale snowy skin. They favor finely stitched furs, often arctic fox, ermine, or bearskin. Some wear helmets made from bear, wolf, or wolverine skulls. A noticeable chill surrounds them. Frost folk villages are extremely remote, found only in very cold terrain. These villages are often cliff dwellings in mountains, deep glacial caverns, or underground caverns deep under everfrost or boreal forests. Frost folk are excellent hunters and herdsmen, keeping flocks of caribou, musk oxen, and mountain sheep. A few villages are able to grow crops around hot springs, in sheltered valleys, and in some warm forested valleys. Frost folk speak Common. 
COMBAT Frost folk are disciplined fighters with a keen sense of tactics. They enjoy bloody slaughter and often set ambushes in deep snow, where axe fighters hide beneath the powder and archers can fire their bows at opponents whose movement is hindered.","
Ice Blast (Su): Frost folk can produce a 20-foot cone of icy mist from their left eye. This deals 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within the area (Reflex save DC 13 half). The save DC is Constitutionbased. Once a frost folk uses his ice blast, he must wait 1d4 rounds before he can use this ability again. 
Snowsight (Ex): All frost folk have innate snowsight, as the spell. No snowstorm can obscure their vision. 
Skills: *All frost folk gain a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in snow and ice terrain. 
FROST FOLK AS PLAYER CHARACTERS Frost folk are feared, and the chill that surrounds them is more than physical. Human tribesfolk don't trust them and call them ""ice demons."" Snow goblins, urskans, and others have a superstitious fear of their ice blast. Frost folk have few friends in the frostfell. Many frost folk are barbarians, befitting their savage nature. Rogues, fighters, clerics, and druids are also common. Very few frost folk are sorcerers or wizards. Frost folk characters possess the following racial traits. - +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma. -Size Medium. -A frost folk's base land speed is 30 feet. -Darkvision out to 60 feet. -Racial Hit Dice: A frost folk begins with four levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +4, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.

An aura of sharp cold surrounds him. Distant relatives of the djinn, qorrash (singular qorrashi) are elemental spirits of cold and ice. A qorrashi appears as a pale blue-skinned humanoid with noble features, and its skin is laced with frost.

A qorrashi is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Qorrash speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan. 
COMBAT Qorrash enjoy physical combat more than their djinn cousins, though they still use their magical abilities to soften up their foes. They are quick to flee from a fight that turns against them. A qorrashi's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.","
Chill (Ex): In addition to its normal slam damage, a qorrashi deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with a successful melee attack. 
Frostbite (Ex): A creature that sustains any cold damage from a qorrashi's melee attacks must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or become frostbitten. Creatures suffering from frostbite are fatigued (cannot run or charge; -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity). These penalties end when the cold damage is healed by any means. The save DC is Constitution-based. 
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-endure elements, invisibility (self only); 3/day-cone of cold (DC 17), ice storm; 1/day-create food and water, gaseous form (up to 1 hour), major creation (created vegetable matter is permanent), persistent image (DC 17), wind walk. Caster level 14th.

Outsider Traits: A qorrashi cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life). It has darkvision out to 60 feet. 
Plane Shift (Sp): Like other genies, a qorrashi can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the qorrashi and up to six other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.

COMBAT This ghost attacks with its horrifi c appearance and frigid touch attacks first, turning to its spells only if its opponents seem to have the upper hand.","
Frigid Touch (Su): This ghost deals 2d6 points of frostburn damage with a touch attack. Horrific Appearance 
(Su): Any living creature within 60 feet who views this ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by this ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours. 
Manifestation (Su): A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partially enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where it is not incorporeal. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. 
Spells: This ghost casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. 
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/6 per day; caster level 3rd): 0-acid splash (+3 ranged touch), daze (DC 14), detect magic, mage hand, touch of fatigue (+3 melee touch; DC 14); 1st-magic missile, silent image (DC 15), sleep (DC 15). 
Incorporeal Traits: A ghost is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be. 
Rejuvenation (Su): If destroyed, this ghost restores itself in 2d4 days with a successful level check (1d20+3) against DC 16. 
Undead Traits: The ghost is immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.

It wears shabby leather armor and carries a wicked spiked club. Snow goblins are shaggy humanoids with large throat sacs that they use to call to one another over long distances. The booming noises they make with these sacs can be heard for miles, and are used to signal hunting and war parties over wide areas. Snow goblins can also create loud monkeylike hoots. A typical snow goblin stands 3 to 4 feet tall, with long arms and seasonal fur color, changing from glossy black or brown in summer to pure white in winter. Its fur is typically crusted with ice and snow. Female snow goblins are larger and more aggressive than males. Both males and females take part in raiding parties, and most people who have met them agree that the females are just as aggressive as the males, and much crueler in the tortures they inflict on captives. Snow goblins speak Common and Goblin. 
COMBAT Snow goblins have a weak grasp of tactics but are quite fearless in their native hills. They often spring simple ambushes against invaders in their territory. These ambushes are sometimes preceded by the deliberate triggering of an avalanche in mountainous terrain. Snow goblins prefer to fight in groups, and both males and females are individually very brave, though they rarely fight in a coordinated way. Usually, snow goblins are servants of greater powers, such as priests of winter deities, frost giants, or ogres. Under such leadership, their morale is quite high.

Ice golems are creatures carved from glacial ice or icebergs, infused with cold energies and a minimal ability to follow orders and then unleashed to serve their creator's will. They are especially dangerous when on icy ground or when fighting in ice caverns. An ice golem cannot speak. It weighs about 2,000 pounds. 
COMBAT Ice golems are unimaginative enemies; they make direct attacks against the nearest foe when ordered to.","
Ice Shards (Su): As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an ice golem can generate a spray of deadly ice shards from its body, dealing 2d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within 10 feet. In addition, living creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. 
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the ice golem must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. 
Construct Traits: An ice golem has immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. Cannot heal damage, but can be repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. Icewalking 
(Ex): This ability works like the spider climb spell but applies to all icy surfaces. An ice golem can move normally on any icy surface. Immunity to Magic 
(Ex): An ice golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. Fire spells and effects affect the golem normally, even if they permit spell resistance (but note the golem's vulnerability to fire). A magical attack that deals cold damage heals an ice golem of 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage such an attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. CREATING AN ICE GOLEM Ice golems are most commonly made by clerics or druids serving winter deities. The cost to create an ice golem is only partly reflected in the cost of finding and carving the ice itself; the greater cost is the expense of the materials and spell components used to strengthen and animate the ice. Creating a golem is exactly like creating any magic item (see page 282 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The golem's creator can carve the body personally or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have ranks in Craft (sculpting). Completing the ritual of creation drains the XP from the creator and requires casting the spells on the fi- nal day. The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls. The golem is carved from a 2,000-pound block of glacial ice. This frame houses the animating energies of the spell, but the channels used to embed the golem's magic are scraped into the ice and written in runes infused a mixture of snowf lake lichen and sapphire dust costing at least 2,000 gp. Assembly requires a successful DC 15 Craft (sculpting) check.

COMBAT Although they are more intelligent than mere animals, ice toads are still too dim for complicated tactics. They attack just about anything, and fight brutally. Like all toads, they attack with their long tongues, using them to drag prey to their mouths.","
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an ice toad must hit a Medium or smaller creature with its tongue attack. If it gets a hold, it begins to drag its target to its mouth. In subsequent rounds, the toad and the target make opposed Strength checks. The toad and the target gain a +4 bonus on this check for each size category larger than Medium, or a -4 penalty for each size category smaller than Medium (an ice toad's usual modifier is +8 for size and Strength). If the ice toad wins the opposed Strength check, the toad drags the victim closer by 1 foot for every point of difference between the check results. If the victim wins the opposed check, it breaks free. If the distance between the toad and the victim is reduced to 0 (when the victim is drawn into the toad's mouth), the toad immediately makes a bite attack as a free action. The target is considered grappled, and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Toads also have improved grab with their bite attacks. To use this ability, the ice toad must hit with its bite attack, either after dragging an opponent to its mouth or simply as a normal melee attack. If it gets a hold, it can swallow whole. 
Sphere of Cold (Su): As a standard action, an ice toad can exude a sphere of numbing cold in a 10-foot radius from its body. Creatures within this radius take 3d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude DC 15 half). The save DC is Constitutionbased. An ice toad can activate this sphere of cold every other round, starting in the first round of combat. 
Swallow Whole (Ex): An ice toad can try to swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least two size catagories smaller than it is (that is, Small or smaller).To swallow a creature, the ice toad must make a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 1d6+6 points of crushing damage plus 1d4 points of acid damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing weapon to kill the toad from the inside (AC 13). A Large ice toad can hold one Small, two Tiny, four Diminutive, or eight Fine creatures in its gut. A Huge ice toad can hold one Medium, two Small, four Tiny, eight Diminutive, or sixteen Fine creatures in its gut.

He wears weather-beaten furs, and his eyes are dark and cold. Over long winters or on high mountain peaks, human remains become freeze-dried husks with perfectly preserved hair, clothes, and skin, but without any liquid remaining in their flesh. When animated, these corpses become icegaunts, intelligent undead tied to alpine glaciers and vast polar ice caps. An icegaunt is a weathered, wrinkled creature with tanned skin and a cold, bony handshake. It can speak, though only haltingly and in a harsh rasp common to frostbite victims. Its clothes are sometimes covered with frost or ice, but otherwise normal for the terrain. Careful observers will notice that icegaunts do not breathe. Icegaunts are commonly the result of sacrifices to mountain gods. In a few cases, icegaunts are created from the bodies of polar explorers, who then wander endlessly, seeking to lead others astray in a frozen death. Because their well-preserved flesh makes them appear more aged than withered, icegaunts can sometimes fool others into following them. As false guides, they inevitably lead others into glacial crevasses or avalanches, or onto dangerously thin ice. Icegaunts speak Common. 
COMBAT In combat, icegaunts prefer to attack by surprise, lurching up from shallow pits dug in snow or ice, or appearing out of a summoned storm of obscuring snow. Like mummies, they are intelligent and fear fire.","
Constitution Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by an icegaunt's slam attack must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each successful drain, the icegaunt gains 5 temporary hit points. Temporary hit points gained in this manner last for up to 1 hour. 
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by an icegaunt rises as an icegaunt at the next midnight. Spawn are under the command of the icegaunt that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. 
Frost Touch (Su): An icegaunt deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with each successful slam attack.

Its skin is mottled with splotches of gray and white, and its large, piercing, cobalt-blue eyes suggest a keen intelligence. The malasynep is a vile creature equally adept at burrowing through everfrost and ice and swimming through slush and water. Only on land does its lack of feet curtail its speed, forcing it to crawl across the surface, convulsing its entire 5,000-pound body to slowly propel itself. Malasyneps travel the frostfell, seeking prey far and wide, using their heat sense to locate potential targets. Though they often eat their kills, malasyneps have a primal need to slay living creatures that enter their territory and will, therefore, attack whenever the opportunity presents itself. This territorial instinct makes the malasynep an excellent guardian, especially for stronger creatures of cold who can dominate, enslave, or strike a mutually beneficial deal with these beasts. The chaotic nature of malasyneps, however, makes them dangerous to trespassers and inhabitants alike, and so they are usually placed in slushy moats, icebergs, or massive chunks of glacier or magically created ice, far from the denizens they were meant to protect.

Once inside, the opponent takes 2d6+7 points of crushing damage plus 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of acid damage per round from the malasynep's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 20 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 13). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; other swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. A Huge malasynep's interior can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium, 16 Small, 64 Tiny, or 256 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 
Amphibious (Ex): Although a malasynep breathes with gills, it can survive indefinitely out of the water. 
Heat Sense (Su): A malasynep can automatically sense heat sources within 60 feet, as the spell detect fire. It senses only the presence or absence of heat, but if it chooses to use a standard action to concentrate on this ability, it can establish the number and location of heat auras and the strength of each in the second and third rounds of concentration.

A typical marzanna stands 6 to 8 feet tall and weighs between 250 and 300 pounds. Their stooped posture makes marzannas seem slightly smaller than they really are, but their marble-white skin and dark brown claws are clear signs that they are not human. They typically dress in ragged layers of poorly cured furs, tattered robes, and worn shawls. Like all hags, marzannas speak Common and Giant. 
COMBAT A marzanna prefers not to fight if she can convince others to give up without a fight, or if she can convince others to do her fighting for her.","
Dreadful Eye (Su): Three times per day a marzanna can cast her dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 10 rounds. Creatures that are panicked by a marzanna's dreadful eye must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or die from fright. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Rend (Ex): A marzanna that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the f lesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+7 points of damage.

He has a sloping brow and a large, strong jaw, and he wears crudely tanned hide armor and carries a mighty club. Neanderthals are primitive cousins of humans who live in caves in cold climates. Their stone tools and weapons are often inferior to those of civilized species, and they compete with goblinoids and orcs for the best caves and hunting grounds. They survive where the beasts they hunt survive: the woolly mammoth, the glyptodon, and the branta. They are sometimes called cave folk. Neanderthals speak Common. 
COMBAT Neanderthals are skilled hunters and work together to take down large prey. When confronted by other humanoids, they fight to defend their territory, but are rarely organized enough to drive determined settlers off their lands. They fight in small clan or family groups; rarely, a charismatic war leader can raise a warband to attack and plunder nearby towns. Some neanderthal tribes have tame saber-toothed tigers as hunting companions. Others ride megaloceroses bareback into battle, though they dismount to fight.","

White puddings are smaller, cold-adapted relatives of the black pudding, and one of the rare oozes that thrive in winter conditions. They live amid ice floes and coastal shelves, and hunt seals, penguins, and other creatures that inhabit pack ice. Their kills are often completely silent, since they smother and consume small prey. White puddings are voracious and do not sleep. Their most active cycle is during the night (when their lack of strong vision is less of a hindrance), but they also stalk prey during daylight hours. When prey eludes them they can survive by dissolving plant material, but this diet seems to eventually sap the creature's reserves of some vital foodstuff. White puddings fed nothing but wood and grasses eventually sicken and die. 
COMBAT White puddings attack by grabbing and squeezing their prey. They attack the closest prey, and can be baited into pursuing whatever target offers itself as closest from round to round.","
Acid (Ex): A white pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect stone or metal. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's armor (if not metal) and clothing dissolves and become immediately useless unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex saving throw. A wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The pudding's acidic touch deals 19 points of damage per round to wooden, leather, or other organic objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. 
Constrict (Ex): A white pudding deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take a -4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid. 
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a pudding must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict its prey. 
Ooze Traits: An ooze is blind (blindsight 60 ft.) and immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. It is immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. 
Spl it (Ex) : Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a white pudding. Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half the original pudding's hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. 
Skills: *White puddings are difficult to spot against snow and ice. They gain a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks in snowy or icy environments.",Books: Frostburn

It has a sharp, black beak, and its dark eyes seem to project an eerie intelligence. Giant ravens are intelligent, mischievous scavengers that dwell among the high places of the frostfell. They are sometimes domesticated as aerial steeds by barbarian tribes. The giant raven is a willful bird, prone to crude practical jokes such as stealing its rider's helmet or weapon and hiding it someplace where the rider can't reach it. Giant ravens born and living in the wild rarely attack other creatures unless they feel threatened or their nests, young, or eggs are endangered. Young ravens can be trained as aerial mounts, though they are less prized than giant eagles, giant owls, or pegasi. Giant ravens speak Common and Giant. 
COMBAT When fighting without a rider, a giant raven prefers to harry its enemy by swooping close to strike and then quickly retreating, rather than enter a stand-up fight. The bird is capable of diving onto targets from a great height, using its sharp beak and daggerlike talons to slash at an opponent's face. A mated pair attacks in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nest, young, or eggs. Several giant ravens sometimes band together to defend their nesting grounds against predators or egg raiders.","
Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant raven takes no damage with a successful saving throw. 
Skills: *Giant ravens receive a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks during daylight hours. TRAINING A GIANT RAVEN Although intelligent, a giant raven requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant raven must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant raven requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a giant raven requires an exotic saddle. A giant raven can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Giant raven eggs are worth 1,500 gp apiece on the open market, while hatchlings are worth 2,500 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant raven.

This creature appears as a jagged lump of ice surrounded by a nimbus of cold blue fire. It walks along the ground with the aid of several thin tendrils. Rimefire eidolons are the living manifestations of the shards of the ancient deity Hleid, who landed in the polar seas after she was struck down ages ago by her nemesis Iborighu. Rimefire eidolons are unusual creatures. As the last physical vestiges of an ancient deity, they carry about them an almost palpable aura of sadness and anger. The intense cold radiated by these creatures when they were first created and cast into the seas caused the waters around them to instantly freeze into massive icebergs. The eidolons were not harmed by this, since they can pass through ice as easily as a fish swims through water. In fact, these icebergs serve as excellent protection against minions of Iborighu, who to this day seek to track down and destroy rimefire eidolons. A rimefire eidolon uses its spell-like abilities to carve complex networks of tunnels and chambers within one of these icebergs. The eidolon then takes care to create dangerous traps and place fierce and loyal guardians in the chambers in an attempt to keep all others (especially is gifted with the ability to mentally seek out and contact a rimefire witch, one of the mortal worshipers of Hleid; when it calls its mortal guardian, it provides directions and passwords in the form of dreams for the guardian to safely reach the rimefire eidolon. A rimefire eidolon in its natural form looks like a 4-foot sphere of light blue fire, swirling around a jagged lump of crystal-clear ice that moves about via several long and thin tendrils made of flexible ice. After bonding with a mortal, a rimefire eidolon changes its appearance to look like an animated statue of ice that is otherwise a perfect replica of its bonded rimefire witch. Rimefire eidolons speak Common, Auran, Aquan, and Sylvan. They are immortal, and have no need to eat, drink, or breathe, but often do so nonetheless simply for entertainment. 
COMBAT Rimefire eidolons avoid melee combat, since they are rather unskilled in it. They prefer to maintain ranged superiority by virtue of their swift fly speed, and use their rimefire bolts and spell-like abilities to defend themselves. If a rimefire eidolon has a bonded rimefire witch and it ever sustains damage or succumbs to a harmful effect, the bonded witch comes to the eidolon's aid as quickly as possible. High-level rimefire witches can use word of recall to instantaneously travel to the heart of a rimefire eidolon's iceberg, and do so without hesitation if their eidolon is ever in danger.","
Frost Touch (Su): A rimefire eidolon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with each successful slam attack. 
Rimefire Bolt (Su): A rimefire eidolon can hurl bolts of the burning radiance that constantly surrounds it. A rimefire bolt has a range of 100 feet, and attacks as a ranged touch attack. The bolt deals damage equal to 3d6 plus the rimefire eidolon's Charisma modifier. Half of this damage is cold damage, and half is fire damage. A rimefire eidolon may use the full attack action to make multiple attacks with rimefire bolts. 
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-blur, clairaudience/ clairvoyance (only within 300 yards of home iceberg), detect evil, detect magic, ice shape, ice slick, obscuring snow, see invisibility; 3/day-chill metal (DC 18), cone of cold (DC 21), ice storm, wall of ice, winter's embrace (DC 20); 1/day-entomb (DC 22), polar ray (+13 ranged touch). Caster level 12th. 
Iceberg Dependent (Su): A rimefire eidolon risks death if it travels more than 300 yards from its iceberg home; if forced to do so, it takes 1d6 points of damage per round until it either dies or is allowed to return to its iceberg. As long as a rimefire eidolon is inside of or in contact with its iceberg, it can use clairaudience/clairvoyance as a spell-like ability at will, as long as the area observed is within 300 yards. Finally, a rimefire eidolon can cause its iceberg to move by concentrating; each round it maintains its concentration, the iceberg moves as it directs at a speed of 20 feet. 
Ice Glide (Ex): An eidolon can glide through ice, snow, or slush as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and its passage does not create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A rimefire eidolon often fights from the cover of an ice wall or snow field in much the same way that an incorporeal creature can use a wall or floor for cover. An eidolon attacking a creature outside the ice or snow in which it is hiding gains the benefit of cover. 
Rimefire Bond (Su): A rimefire eidolon may forge a powerful spiritual bond with an aspiring rimefire witch. Doing so requires the rimefire eidolon to simply touch the target and will the bond to exist. Once it is forged, this bond is a permanent effect and cannot be dispelled or destroyed. If a rimefire witch or her eidolon is killed, this bond is broken. If the slain member of the bond is brought back to life within a year of death, the rimefire bond instantly reforges itself despite any physical distance between the two. As long as the bond exists, a rimefire eidolon knows the location and condition of its bonded witch as if by the status spell. Additionally, the rimefire eidolon gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting and death effects. This bond is powerful enough that it can extend across planar boundaries. 
Tremorsense (Ex): An eidolon can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground (or ice or snow on top of the ground).",Books: Frostburn

Her skin is pale white, and her hair is a strange shade of gold and green. She wears nothing but a slim diaphanous shawl. Rusalkas are female spirits who dwell in lakes, rivers, and streams. Their beguiling song is known to lure men to watery graves. Their clothing is usually nothing more than a gown or shawl, and some rusalkas go bare skinned. Some believe rusalkas to be the restless spirits of drowned maidens, tied to the place of their deaths. However, they are in fact water spirits. Most of the time, just one rusalka inhabits a body of water, but sometimes a small covey lives in an area. Rusalkas generally lead lonely lives, but some tales indicate that vodyanoi take rusalka wives. To ease their loneliness, these fey often use their song to entice men to join them. Some evil or neutral rusalkas are content to let their victims drown, while good rusalkas might confer water breathing upon enamored mortals. Relationships between willing mortals and rusalkas are doomed to end in sadness. The rusalka inevitably frees her paramour or forces him to leave by refusing to give him the ability to breathe water when she realizes he is not truly content to live in her world beneath the water's surface. Rusalkas speak Aquan, Common, and Sylvan. 
COMBAT A rusalka does not look for martial conf lict, only lovers or victims. If threatened, she will often flee, using her natural hiding skills and knowledge of waterways to evade pursuers.","
Beguiling Song (Su): A rusalka can attempt to beguile creatures with her song. The rusalka sings, targeting a single creature it can see within 300 feet of her body of water (see Water Symbiosis, below). This is a sonic, mind-affecting ability, and the creature must be able to hear the rusalka for it to take effect. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Will saving throw. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that rusalka's song for 24 hours. Failure indicates the creature is utterly beguiled and moves toward the rusalka, taking the most direct route available. If that path leads into a dangerous area (such as very deep or fast-moving water), the beguiled creature is entitled to a second saving throw. A rusalka who desires a companion often moves out of the water and bestows water breathing on its beguiled victim so that she can take him underwater. A beguiled creature may take no actions other than defending himself. A beguiled victim who moves within 5 feet of the rusalka must make a DC 18 Will saving throw or be charmed as per charm monster cast by an 8th-level sorcerer. Success means that the character is freed from the beguilement and is immune to that rusalka's beguiling song for 24 hours. The beguiling effect continues as long as the rusalka sings. A rusalka need not continue to sing to keep a victim charmed. A rusalka can use her beguiling song both above and below the water. Good rusalkas cast water breathing on their charmed companions to keep them alive below the waves. Evil rusalkas move into deep water, forcing a beguiled victim to move toward them but never allowing the victim to get within 5 feet. If these unlucky creatures fail their second saving throw, they usually drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Water Breathing (Sp): Four times per day, a rusalka can use water breathing as a 12th-level sorcerer. 
Water Symbiosis (Su): Each rusalka is mystically bound to a body of water or waterway as small as a pond or as large as a lake or river. Although aquatic, a rusalka can move as far as 300 yards from the body of water to which she is bound and breathe normally. If she strays farther than that, she must hold her breath or immediately start to drown. Once a rusalka has moved beyond the boundary of her connection, she cannot breathe normally until she has immersed herself in her body of water. 
Skills: *A rusalka gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist and Hide checks when in contact with the body of water in which she lives. A rusalka gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.",Books: Frostburn

Three long, grasping claws and six slavering jaws on rubbery tentacles dangle from its body, and its body is dotted with small black eyes that glare with hatred. Only the largest white dragons can challenge the massive and terrible shivhad when it comes to establishing territory. Thankfully, shivhads are quite rare, and they spend much of their time sleeping underneath their chosen glaciers. A shivhad is a spiderlike creature with eight spiny legs and a round body it carries high off the ground. Between the creature's legs extend long tentacles, three to a side, and each one is tipped with a slavering maw filled with sharklike teeth. Three long, grasping claws on multijointed arms dangle from its belly, and a number of savage black eyes stare out from random points on its chitinous body. Shivhads are incredibly intelligent, although their motives are alien to most other creatures. They do not seem to be driven to reproduce or expand their territories. They subjugate local tribes of intelligent creatures (often frost giants or ogres), using their might to establish themselves almost as deities to these creatures. All they demand of their minions is the sacrifice of at least one intelligent being per week; such sacrifices are brought out to the shivhad's glacier and left alone for the creature to stalk, torment, and eventually eat. A shivhad has an uncanny knowledge of languages and can speak all the tongues native to its area. A shivhad that acquires additional languages speaks them perfectly, without any trace of accent. When a shivhad speaks, it does so from all six of its mouths, creating a booming presence that is difficult to ignore. 
COMBAT A shivhad makes full use of its feats in combat. Against single foes, it usually uses a Spring Attack tactic: burrowing up close to the victim, attacking with a bite, and then burrowing down into the ice out of reach. When presented with more than six foes, a shivhad enjoys wading into their midst, perhaps making a crush attack. A shivhad usually sacrifices 5 points from its attack rolls to aid its Armor Class using the Combat Expertise feat, as well; it rarely encounters creatures that it has diffi culty hitting.","
Ability Drain (Su): Any creature struck by a shivhad's bite must make a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2 points of drain to each ability score (or 4 points to each score on a critical hit). A shivhad gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains ability scores. Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based. 
Cold Aura (Su): A shivhad radiates an aura of extreme cold. Any creature within 60 feet of a shivhad takes 3d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of its turn each round. This aura extinguishes nonmagical flames in its area as well. 
Crush (Ex): A shivhad can drop its body on opponents three or more size categories smaller than itself (usually, Medium or smaller) as a full-round action, using its weight to crush them. A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the shivhad's space. Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a DC 33 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+11 points of bludgeoning damage. Thereafter, if the shivhad chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. While pinned, the opponent takes bludgeoning damage each round. The save DC is Strength-based. 
Absorb Cold (Su): Any cold spell or effect targeted on a shivhad that fails to overcome its spell resistance is absorbed into the creature's body. This effect cures 5 points of damage per level of the spell or effect absorbed. 
*Glacier Bond (Su): A shivhad has a mystical bond with its home glacier. As long as it remains on this glacier, it can determine the exact location of any living creatures in contact with the glacier, up to a range of 10 miles. This knowledge grants it a +6 insight bonus to its Armor Class and Reflex saving throws against any opponent who is also in contact with its glacier, and allows the shivhad to pinpoint otherwise hidden or invisible targets with ease. These bonuses to Armor Class and Reflex saving throws are included in the statistics above.",Books: Frostburn

It has two eellike heads studded with small, silver eyes, and a long, lashing, whiplike tail. The creature is pale white in color, blending in with the snowy surroundings. Sometimes called ""snow ghosts"" because of their ability to drift silently along in snowstorms to attack prey, snowcloaks are flying predators of the northerly foothills that resemble flying rays or skates. Snowcloaks are slate gray on one side and creamy white on the other; they habitually fly dark side down, flapping their wings gently and gliding for long distances. A snowcloak has two long, sinuous necks ending in dark gray heads studded with rows of silver-hued eyes. Each head has a long, pointed jaw filled with needle-sharp teeth. Wandering predators that lack lairs, snowcloaks are usually encountered lying concealed on snow-covered slopes, or flying low along the ground in snowstorms, seeking prey. Snowcloaks speak Auran and Common. 
COMBAT Snowcloaks are cunning, patient hunters, often drifting along after dark to pounce on nocturnal creatures as they emerge from lairs and burrows. Snowcloaks attack by landing atop prey and biting or clubbing with the fearsome bone knobs on their tails, while tearing with their poisonous claws. Snowcloaks often avoid dangerous prey. If they believe a foe can be overcome, snowcloaks favor an extended hit-and-run battle, slashing quickly among their enemies with flyby attacks and then moving off and using their regeneration to recover, while their intended prey grows weaker and runs out of magic, missile weapons, and the will to resist.","

Its eyes are bright and yellow, and its fangs seem almost solid. A spirit wolf looks like a ghostly wolf with glowing yellow eyes. Its howl is exceptionally mournful, and it can move those closely allied to nature to tears. Spirit wolves are often found in forested areas infested with more dangerous and evil undead or outsiders, and serve to protect the forest and its animal denizens from harm. 
COMBAT A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.","
Manifestation (Su): A spirit wolf dwells on the Ethereal Plane and is an ethereal creature. As an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a spirit wolf manifests (usually at the request of a powerful spellcaster) it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane (see below). A manifested spirit wolf can strike with its natural attacks; these attacks deal nonlethal damage to physical creatures. A manifested spirit wolf remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested spirit wolf can be attacked by opponents on either the Material or Ethereal planes. The spirit wolf's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not against foes on the Ethereal Plane. Although a spirit wolf has two home planes, the Material and the Ethereal, it is not considered extraplanar when on either plane. 
Trip (Ex): A spirit wolf that hits an ethereal opponent with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (+1 check modifier) without making a touch attack or provoking attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf. (Despite the fact that gravity does not exist on the Ethereal Plane, it is still possible to place an opponent in a disadvantaged position.) 
Incorporeal Traits: A spirit wolf is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be. 
Scent (Ex): A spirit animal can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. A spirit animal using the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell. 
Skills: *Spirit wolves receive a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent, and a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks.",Books: Frostburn

A pair of curving horns and two razor-sharp tusks jut from its fearsome head. Although the tlalusk is an herbivore that feeds on roots and other tubers it digs out of the frozen ground with its tusks, it is notoriously ill-tempered, and most carnivores give the beast a wide berth. A tlalusk looks something like a muscular horse the size of an elephant, except the creature has six legs and is covered with white fur. The beast's head is wider than a horse's, and it sports a pair of huge horns and razor-sharp tusks, as well. Frost giants are fond of capturing and training tlalusks as mounts. A battalion of frost giants mounted on tlalusks and armed with lances is a formidable sight indeed. Tlalusks understand some Giant, but they cannot speak. 
COMBAT A tlalusk's first instinct in combat is to use its bellow to stun the enemy. It then charges toward the foe, often combining the charge attack with a bull rush. If the enemy still stands, the tlalusk remains to pound it into the ground with its hooves, and then roots it out and finishes the job with its tusks.","
Bellow (Su): Once per minute, a tlalusk can bellow. This horribly loud blast affects a 30-foot cone, but can be heard for miles. Any creature within the area must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or save indicates the creature is deafened for only 1 round, and not stunned. 
Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each round, a tlalusk can run over Large or smaller opponents. This attack deals 2d8+15 points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a -4 penalty or a DC 28 Ref lex save for half damage. 
Scent (Ex): A tlalusk can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. TRAINING A TLALUSK Although intelligent, a tlalusk requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a tlalusk must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer. This can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check, but tlalusks are usually hostile toward almost any would-be trainer other than a frost giant, toward whom they are normally unfriendly. Training a friendly tlalusk requires six weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal check. Riding a trained tlalusk requires an exotic saddle. Up to four Medium or smaller creatures can ride on a tlalusk comfortably, although this requires an exotic saddle that costs four times the normal amount, and only one of the riders can attempt to control the tlalusk with Ride checks each round. A tlalusk can fight while carrying riders, but the riders cannot also attack unless they succeed on Ride checks Young tlalusks are worth 10,000 gp on the open market, although most cities that know anything about the beasts have made trafficking in tlalusks illegal within city walls because of the destruction even a young one can wreak. Professional trainers charge 5,000 gp to rear or train a tlalusk.

She wears a jerkin of leather armor studded with copper rivets and carries a shield and a sword. Uldras are small fey that dwell in the arctic wilderness, living at peace with the natural world. In particular, uldras are quite fond of the wild animals of the world, and see themselves as the guardians and protectors of such creatures, especially in cases where civilization encroaches. Although they generally prefer to avoid conflict, they are quick to rise in the defense of local wildlife. An uldra has long, thin limbs, with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. Skin color ranges from pale blue to snow white, with darker shades of hair. Their ears and eyes are large, but their other facial features are small. An uldra's eyes are very large and colorful, and often have two or three colors (combinations of green, gold, and red are the most common). In the dark, their eyes seem to glow with a soft light. Uldras prefer to dress simply in rustic clothing, and often eschew clothing altogether. The major exception is hats; uldras have a deep love of hats (especially pointed hats) and it is rare indeed to see a hatless uldra. All uldras speak Common, Sylvan, and at least four other languages (usually Aquan, Auran, Gnome, and Terran). 
COMBAT Uldras prefer to use magic or ranged weaponry in combat, using their small size to full advantage to gain cover from their enemies. They often rely on animal friends and companions to engage enemies in melee, but they never abandon an animal to its fate if a battle starts to turn sour. Most uldras gladly surrender or even lay down their lives in order to spare an animal from death or capture.","

-Cold Resistance (Ex): All uldras have resistance to cold 5. 
-Frosty Touch (Su): As a free action, an uldra can infuse his hands with cold. While his hands are frosty, an uldra's unarmed attacks do an additional 1 point of cold damage. Any melee weapon an uldra wields deals an additional 1 point of cold damage on a successful hit. This additional damage does not stack with a magic weapon's ability to deal cold damage (if any).

Its formidable claws are tipped with deadly steel blades, and its blue eyes gleam with intelligence. It seems to move equally well on two legs or four. The urskans are a race of intelligent, tool-using bearlike creatures that rule over large areas of tundra and boreal forest despite their relatively small numbers. Singly, they are fearsome. Gathered into an army, they are almost unstoppable. Urskans are often also referred to as armored bears because of their love of heavy steel armor when fighting to defend their territory. Their enormous muscle and their ""thumb claw"" (a false but usable thumb a resembling that of a giant panda) allow them to wield hammers and work iron, and their intelligence and careful workmanship are reflected in flexible suits of plate armor with breastplates up to 1 inch thick. The full suits can weigh up to 500 pounds. Urskans speak Common and Urskan. 
COMBAT Urskans are carnivores that depend on a diet of seal, walrus, and fish to keep them going through the long winters. As a result, they are astounding predators, and are especially dangerous in pack ice, where their swimming and ice abilities come into play. When on land, they often don heavy iron plate armor for battles to defend their territory, and add steel tips to their already deadly claws. Urskans are proficient with simple weapons, their deadly steelclaws, and all forms of armor, but not shields.","
Powerful Charge (Ex): An urskan often begins a battle by charging at an opponent, hurling its powerful body at a foe. In addition to the benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the urskan to make a single slam attack at a +11 attack bonus that deals 2d8+10 points of damage. 
Rend (Ex): If an urskan hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d8+10 points of damage. 
Scent (Ex): An urskan can detect opponents within 30 feet. The exact location is not revealed unless the creature is within 5 feet. 
Surefooted (Ex): Urskans ignore all move ment penalties associated with snow on the ground. They also receive a +4 racial bonus on Balance checks when walking on ice or snow. 
Skills: *An urskan's white fur gives it a +8 racial bonus on Hide attempts while unarmored in snow or icy terrain (thus an unarmored urskan has a Hide check modifier of +5 in suitable terrain).

His wet skin has a greenish hue, and he has a round potbelly and long arms. His nails are long, thick, and dirty. Vodyanoi are moody fey that dwell in the rivers and lakes of cold lands. Their powers allow them considerable control over their environment; they can alter a river's water level drastically and ensure that schools of fish are plentiful or scarce. Vodyanoi act as both providers and destroyers to those who live near their domains. Rarely seen by humans, vodyanoi appear as old men with potbellies and beards. Their hair is a messy tangle of green and yellow reeds. Their aged appearance belies their strength and agility, and their long nails are vicious claws. Vodyanoi can breathe air just as easily as water, but they do not often leave the comfort of their homes. Villagers who live near a river or lake are careful to make sacrifices of fish or cattle to the local vodyanoi. Anyone whose trade depends on water makes offerings as well, from fishermen to millers who use the river to power a waterwheel. Vodyanoi that have been placated are more likely to provide schools of fish and keep the river from leaving its bed. They are known for their unpredictable natures, so regular sacrifices are no guarantee of their favor. On the other hand, a vodyanoi that is shown disrespect will probably retaliate by drowning a villager or fisherman. The angered fey might also pursue harsher actions, perhaps flooding an entire village or sweeping away bridges. On rare occasions, a vodyanoi might attempt to trade with isolated locals (it will not stroll into the village market). It might offer fish or some treasure found in the river in exchange for a cow. Although it might seem obvious, folktales advise listeners that one could tell a strange trader was a vodyanoi if water puddles around his feet. Vodyanoi speak Common and Sylvan. 
COMBAT Vodyanoi are wily fey, ready to ambush anyone who is already in the water or even at the water's edge. Sometimes a vodyanoi will use its power to sweep victims into a river by causing a sudden flood.","
Control Water (Sp): A vodyanoi can use control water three times per day as a 10thlevel sorcerer. 
Fish Cloud (Sp): When submerged in water, a vodyanoi can summon a huge school of magic fish to provide concealment (similar to the fog cloud spell). This school of fish swims around the point the vodyanoi designates in a 20-foot radius. This cloud of fish obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A strong current disperses the cloud of fish in 4 rounds. A very strong current disperses the fish in 1 round. The fish created by this spell are formed of magic; they are not real animals, and objects and energies pass through them as though they were not there. A vodyanoi can summon a fish cloud three times per day. The fish cloud remains for 40 minutes or until dispersed or dispelled. Vodyanoi sometimes use this ability to deceive villagers, making them think the vodyanoi have brought fish to their waters. When vodyanoi really want to reward people with fish, they use their Survival skill to lure fish into an area. 
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a vodyanoi must hit a single foe of the same size or smaller with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it gets a hold, the vodyanoi often attempts to pin a foe and hold him underwater until he drowns. 
Amphibious (Ex): Although vodyanoi live in water, they can survive out of water indefinitely.

Its skin is the sickly white of frostbite, and its lips and fingertips are a dead, cold blue. Sharp crystals of ice pierce its sagging skin. A winterspawn is a frozen undead warrior carrying weapons of crystalline ice. It can command other undead into its service, and its intelligence and canny tactics make it a deadly foe. It often rides white dragons or frost worms that have been pressed into service. The eyes of a winter spawn are said to be black pits foretelling the doom of its foes, but this is mostly legend. Its eyes are dark blue. The limbs of winterspawns are sometimes deformed by the presence of ice crystals within their flesh; this puts lumps and ripples in their skin, or makes their flesh sag when the crystals expand and contract. Winterspawns speak Common. 
COMBAT Winterspawns are the officers of undead armies, commanding ghouls, wights, icegaunts, entombed, or other undead. They prefer to remain well behind the lines, using their frost glance and ice javelin to help their troops. If pressed into hand-to-hand combat, they use their icy swords to good effect.","
Command Undead (Ex): Five times per day, a winterspawn can rebuke or command other undead as a 12th-level cleric. As long as its minions are within 120 feet, a winterspawn need not speak to command its slaves, directing them through mental contact. 
Frost Glance (Su): As a free action once per round, a winterspawn can blast a single foe within 60 feet with its frost glance. This deals 4d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude DC 18 half ). 
Fire Shield (Sp): At will, a winterspawn can create a fire shield on itself (caster level 12th, cold flames only). While the fire shield is in effect, the winterspawn takes only half damage from fire-based attacks (or, if the attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, no damage on a successful save). Any creature striking a winterspawn with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6+12 points of cold damage. Creatures wielding reach weapons, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage. 
Ice Arms (Ex): A winterspawn's weapons are made of magical ice in razor-sharp crystalline shards. Its sword is a +2 keen icy burst longsword, and its javelin is a +2 returning icy burst javelin. These weapons deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with each hit (or an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a critical hit). A winterspawn also wears +3 scale mail made of ice. A winterspawn's armor and weapons other wise resemble normal versions of these weapons, but dissipate into vapor 24 hours after the winterspawn who created them is destroyed unless the item succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude save. 
Undead Traits: A winterspawn is immune to mindaffecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.",Books: Frostburn

Yeti stand about 8 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds or more. Their powerful bodies are covered in long, white fur.

Her skin is a light blue, her hair is long and black, and her lips are red and full. She wears snowy white robes that billow around her. Beautiful spirits of the frozen wastes, yuki-on-nas are either hateful and destructive or kindly and helpful. In either case, they can be dangerous, since those who pursue them, whatever their intention, often find themselves lost in a blizzard. A yuki-on-na appears as a human female of the rarest beauty. She has waist-length black hair, soft blue eyes, and full red lips. Her skin is pale blue and icy to the touch.

COMBAT Yuki-on-nas are virtually never seen except during a heavy snowfall. Evil yuki-on-nas take these opportunities to attack from hiding, while good ones are often seen dancing through the snow.
