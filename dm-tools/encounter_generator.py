All for random CR: Pick CR in range from 1 to max
Pick CR of first set of monsters between 1/4 and max CR
Pick random monster in that CR
See if you can add more of that monster
If you can pick random number between 1 and max
Pick random monster from remainder CR if any left
Try to narrow down by type/subtype
See if you can add more of that monster
If you can pick random number between 1 and max


Add back in the varies monsters
Eventually add templates
