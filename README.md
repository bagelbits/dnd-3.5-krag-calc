================

Damage calculator for D&amp;D character

Deals with choosing between shield bash (charging or not), gore, and throwing boulders.
Also deals with cleave damage too. Auto-rolling dice can be turned off for manual rolls.

TODO:
Shield Bash
Gore

Nice to have:
GUI
Executable app for Mac and Windows
Read stats off the XML dump of my character sheet.

Final Goal:
Web based app that DM can set AC and HP for enemies and it takes care of all rolls.
