krag_calc
================

Damage calculator for D&amp;D character

Deals with choosing between shield bash (charging or not), gore, and throwing boulders. As well as all feats that modify my combat damage. Also deals with cleave damage too. Auto-rolling dice can be turned off for manual rolls.

TODO:
Rage feat/Bear form bonus feat


Nice to have:
GUI
Executable app for Mac and Windows
Read stats off the XML dump of my character sheet.
Abstract out feat mods.

Final Goal:
Web based app that DM can set AC and HP for enemies and it takes care of all rolls.
Mobile based app.

Far Reaching Goal:
Module designed general use combat damage calc with interchangeable feat mods and item mods.
