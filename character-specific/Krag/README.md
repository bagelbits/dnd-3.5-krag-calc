krag_calc
================

Damage calculator for D&amp;D character

Deals with choosing between shield bash (charging or not), gore, and throwing boulders. As well as all feats 
that modify my combat damage. Also deals with cleave damage too. Auto-rolling dice can be turned off for 
manual rolls. Now will important stats from the character xml.

TODO:
* Test Rage code
* Clean up code again
* Bear form bonus feat
* Print out HP, Saves, AC at the end of round, and keep track if they're altered due to Rage or the like
* Keep track of HP

Nice to have:
* GUI
* Executable app for Mac and Windows
* Abstract out feat mods.

Final Goal:
* Web based app that DM can set AC and HP for enemies and it takes care of all rolls.
* Mobile based app.

Far Reaching Goal:
* Module designed general use combat damage calc with interchangeable feat mods and item mods.
