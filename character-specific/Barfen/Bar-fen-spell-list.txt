Both creatures must be in range, and you must be able to target them both (as if this spell had them as its targets).

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Fog spreads in a 30ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: No
    A bank of fog composed entirely of tiny, razor-sharp ice shards billows out from the targeted point. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
    In addition, the sharp ice particles tear the skin of those moving through the area, causing 4 points of; damage per round, half of which is cold damage.
    A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. Dispersing the fog in this manner, however, causes damage to those within its area as the icy shards whip past. A strong wind causes 4 points of damage per round (half cold); a severe wind causes S points of damage (half cold).

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    With a word and a tapping of the finger, the object you touch suddenly begins to radiate shadow, with the darkest area at its center.
    This spell causes an object to radiate darkness within a shape (cone, square or sphere) and a radius to be determined by the caster (maximum 10 feet per caster level). Unlike darkness, this spell radiates what appears to be natural darkness, meaning that the nearer a person or object gets to the center of the effect, the darker the area appears. Any character or object (including normal lights and light-generating spells of less than 5th level) which crosses the center line will no longer be visible to anyone on the opposite side. To the character that actually crosses the line, the darkness appears to fade as he continues out of the area of effect.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: One ashstar; see text
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a magical construct called an ashstar. It shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of the range. Each round, you can move the ashstar anywhere within range by spending a move action to concentrate on the new position. The ash star gives off a reddish light, akin to the hazy light within a sandstorm, providing shadowy illumination in a 20-foot radius. A creature you designate within 10 feet of the ashstar that takes damage from any source must make a Fortitude saving throw. On a failed save, the damage is considered desiccation damage, and the victim becomes dehydrated.
    An ashstar can be attacked as if it were an object. It has hardness 10 and 10 hit points

Target: One spell trigger activation item
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    An awaken from afar spell allows you to use a spell trigger item without actually touching the item. The item to be activated must be within the range of the awaken from afar spell, and it functions as though you yourself were triggering it from its current position. All other conditions, such as the requirement that you have the spell on your spell list or if the item's enchantment restricts its use to a particular race or individual, still apply. Both you and the item to be activated have to be on the same plane. The item cannot be in the possession of another creature at the time of activation, and it must be an item that you have previously triggered normally (in other words, without the aid of an awaken from afar spell.

As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a subject. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level  (maximum 15d6), though a successful Reflex save negates that damage.
    The ball moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you), otherwise it merely stays at rest, damaging any creature in its space. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The lightning winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
    Material Component: A handful of copper and iron pellets.

    The victim must succeed on a Reflex save or be immobilized and thus unable to move. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is only partially trapped by the bands, and is entangled.
    A creature immobilized by the bands can attempt to escape as a full-round action, either by bursting free (Strength DC 18) or wriggling out (Escape Artist DC 18).
    An entangled creature can use a full-round action to break free (Strength DC 13) or disentangle itself (Escape Artist DC 13).
    Material Component: Three small silver hoops, interlocked.

Effect: Bat guano in a 5ft-radius spread
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Bat accident creates a mass of bat guano that covers an area or, if present, any one single target caught in the effect. The bat guano appears to stream from an invisible source of the caster's choice (typically above the victim's head or in front of their face).
    Because of the nauseating stench, a creature covered with guano is unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, and so on. The only action a nauseated character may take is a single move action per round. The guano also deals 1d6 points of acid damage to creatures and objects.
    This spell was created by Helcawn Stron, a slave owner of Vrendolen, whose slaves collect bat guano by the shipload. Stron uses this spell on obnoxious people who like to mock his unusual source of income at parties.
    Material Component: A pinch of dried bat guano.

    You point the shard of carved ram's horn at your foe and snap off the last words of the spell. An invisible wedge of force slams into the creature's midsection, doubling it over and driving it back.
    You create a ram-like force that can strike with considerable power. The force can target a creature or an object. The force deals 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the subject is a creature, this attack initiates a bull rush (as a Medium creature with Strength 30, for a +10 bonus on the bull rush attempt). If the subject is a movable object, such as a door, you can make a Strength check (with a +10 bonus) to attempt to force open the door.

Effect: 20 ft-radius spread
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: No
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles. These waving members seem to spring up from the floor, soil, water, or whatever other surface is underfoot. They bash and slice creatures that enter the tentacle field, assaulting their targets with great strength. The tentacles are studded with irregular short fin-like spines, having edges as sharp as many swords.
    The tentacles make one melee attack every round against every creature within the affected area. Treat the tentacles as Medium creatures with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a strength score of 19. They deal 2d6+4 points of damage with each successful hit. Half of the damage is slashing and the other half is bludgeoning.
    Any creature that enters the affected area is immediately attacked by the tentacles and can only move through the area at half speed. To you, the tentacles seem insubstantial and you can pass freely.
    Material Component: A piece of tentacle from an octopus or squid, and a piece of spine or bone from an aquatic creature.

    Battlefield Illumination [Heroes of Battle]
Evocation [Light]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Crusader (base) 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 4, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Knight of the Chase 4, Metal Master 4, Mystic 4, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 4, Wild Reaper 4, Wind Walker 4, Winter Warden 4, Wizard 4

Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Area: 80ft-radius cylinder, 40ft-high
Duration: 10 minutes / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    When you cast battlefield illumination, a soft light illuminates the area. This effect improves the illumination in the area by one category (from darkness to shadowy, or shadowy to bright light). It does not stack with other magical light effects.
    Unlike other spells with the light descriptor, battlefield illumination counters and dispels early twilight but does not affect other darkness spells.

    Bedevil [Champions of Ruin]
Conjuration (Summoning) [Evil]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Blackguard 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Pious Templar 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: See text
Effect: A spirit imp.
Duration: 1 day / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You summon a mischievous spirit and send it to bedevil your enemy. The spirit seeks out its assigned victim wherever she might be, as long as she is on the same plane as you when you cast the spell. It then proceeds to irritate and annoy her through a variety of manifestations. The victim of a bedevil spell finds herself constantly seeing movement out of the corner of her eye. Her sleep is frequently interrupted by bed shaking and blanket shifting, and the sounds of voices that fade when waking. When spellcasting, she suffers a variety of minor irritations that threaten to disrupt her spells, and she constantly feels haunted and watched. The result of this bedevilment is that she takes a -1 penalty on all ability checks, skill checks, and Will saving throws, and has a 5% chance of arcane spell failure (which stacks with any spell failure chance from armor worn).
    Detect evil cast upon the subject of this spell reveals the presence of the bedeviling spirit, while protection from evil keeps the spirit from adversely affecting the victim. A dispel evil spell destroys the mischievous spirit, but remove curse or similar magic has no effect on it.
    Material Component: A tiny iron statuette of a devil or imp, plus either a drop of the intended victim's blood or one personal article belonging to the intended victim.

    Bigby's Disrupting Hand [Player's Handbook II]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: One hand of force
Duration: 1 minute (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A small, spectral human hand springs into existence before your target. It hovers in the air, ready to deliver a backhanded blow.
    Like Bigby's interposing hand, this spell creates a magical construct in the form of a human hand. The hand targets a single opponent of your choice within range. You choose this opponent as you cast the spell. You can target a different opponent with this spell by taking a move action to do so.
    When the subject of Bigby's disrupting hand attempts to cast a spell, the hand punches him. This attack causes no damage, but it forces the subject to make a Concentration check with a DC equal to this spell's save DC. If the subject fails the check, the hand's blow ruins his casting attempt.
    The hand is about 1 foot long. It has hit points equal to half your full normal hit points, and its AC is 20 (+4 size, +6 natural). It makes saving throws using your total save bonuses and takes damage from spells and attacks as normal.
    Focus: A soft glove.

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: 10ft hand
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell functions like Bigby's interposing hand, except the forceful hand pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always moves with the opponent to push him back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action
    A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the hand would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing the it.
    Focus: A sturdy glove made of leather or heavy cloth.

    Bigby's Interposing Hand [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Duskblade 4, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Trapsmith 3, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: 10ft hand
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Bigby's interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand - it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
    A Bigby's interposing hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it.
    Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.
    Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
    Focus: A soft glove.

A successful Fortitude save negates the nausea and halves the damage. In addition, this gas obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target; creatures that rely on the scent ability cannot locate the caster while this spell is in effect). While you are immune to the stench and acid damage of your own spell, you are affected by this spell's darkness. Holding one's breath does not help to avoid the effects of this spell.
    A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses this gas in 4 rounds. A strong or greater wind (21+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses this gas in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the gas in its area of effect. A wall of fire burns away the gas in the area into which it deals damage.
    This spell does not function underwater. Any stench or scent-based ability you or creatures in the area of effect possess is overwhelmed and does not function.
    Arcane Material Component: A piece of a troglodyte's tail.

It has a reach of 20 feet (though it can't make attacks of opportunity).

The subject gestures as if making a melee attack, but the result of the attack affects a target within range. This spell does not actually grant reach, and so does not help provide a flanking bonus or allow the subject to make attacks of opportunity at any range greater than normal. The subject uses its normal melee attack bonuses and deals damage normally if it hits, though the target of the attacks can benefit from cover or concealment.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell, commonly used by the armathors of Myth Drannor in the apprehension of criminals, snares the target in a tangle of invisible, razor-sharp briars of mystical energy. The affected creature suffers no ill effects as long as it does not attempt to move, attack, cast a spell with material or somatic components, or perform any other action that requires movement. During any round in which the target moves in any fashion, however, it takes 1d8 points of damage (no save). Damage from the spell disrupts spellcasting; a subject that attempts to cast a spell with a material or somatic component must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level + damage dealt) or lose the spell.
    Material Component: A drop of blood.

Effect: A bloodstar
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    In a ruby flash a blood-colored, glowing crystal appears near your foes to suck the blood from their wounds.
    You create a magic construct called a bloodstar that shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of the range (each round, you can move the bloodstar anywhere within range with a standard action spent concentrating on the new position). The bloodstar pulses with ruby light (providing illumination in a 20-foot radius). Any creature you initially designate within 10 feet of the bloodstar that takes damage from any source must make a saving throw. On a failed save, the victim takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Each time victims are damaged, they can attempt new saves.
    The bloodstar cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks.
    Focus: A ruby worth at least 30 gp.

Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: Cone-shaped burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half, then Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A shimmering 10 foot-tall cloud made of gold, red, violet, and blue energy springs into existence, resembling rolling fire and lightning. The cloud appears in front of the caster and sweeps outward to extent of the range.
    Creatures struck by the cloud take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The damage is one-quarter electricity, one-quarter fire, one-quarter negative energy, and one-quarter positive energy. Unlike the negative energy from inflict light wounds, this spell does not cure undead creatures, nor does the positive energy cure living creatures.
    Creatures that fail their Reflex save, are struck by the full force of the storm and must make a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to stunning are immune to being dazed by this spell.
    This spell can be made permanent with permanency (minimum caster 11th; 1,500 XP), in which case it creates a straight cloud 5 foot-wide, 10 foot-tall, and 25 foot-long +5 ft/2 levels, and deals 2d6 points of damage +1 damage per caster level, to any creature that contacts the wall. A creature that passes through the wall, must make a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round.
    Material Component: Four stones, one for each of the colors of the cloud.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal; see text
Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
    You are surrounded in flame, which does not harm you or your equipment. When you move, you leave a vertical trail of flame in your wake. The sheet of flame left behind you is up to 20 feet high, 2 inches wide, and lengthens as you move, exactly following the path you take across a horizontal surface-you leave no trail on vertical surfaces or through the air because the sheet of flame must be anchored on a horizontal surface.
    The blazing wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum + 20) to any creature passing through it. If you pass through a square more than once, the damage dealt by the wall to creatures moving through that square does not increase. You take no damage from your own blazing wall.
    If you overrun a creature or otherwise manage to pass through its square, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that section goes out.
    Material Component: A small piece of phosphorus.

Spell Resistance: No (object)
    The boil spell causes a volume of water to reach boiling temperature and vigorously boil instantly. The amount of water affected depends on the level of the caster. If the amount of water affected by the spell is less than the amount of water present, the affected amount will boil, but only half the duration. A person submerged in boiling water will take 3d4 points of damage per round. A person splashed with boiling water on clothing or naked skin (from a thrown flask, for example) will take 1d4 points of damage. When the spell ends, the water will instantly return to its former state.

Area: 10ft-radius cylinder, 40ft-high
Duration: 1 round and 1 round / 3 levels; see text

    A torrent of boiling oil rains down in the area you specify. Creatures in the area take 4d6 points of scalding (fire) damage from the oil. Creatures that fail their initial saving throw take an additional 2d6 points of damage in each subsequent round of the spell's duration (up to a maximum of 6 rounds at 18th-level).

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Target: One creature with bones
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a deep resonating vibration that damages bone. It does not affect creatures that do not have true bones (such as elementals, incorporeal creatures, most golems, oozes, plants, or purely ectoplasmic creatures) or that are under the effect of spells that alter their bones (such as stone bones, or a polymorph spell to turn into a boneless creature), but does affect creatures with exoskeletons instead of humanlike bones (such as vermin). The spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4).
    Material Component: A tiny bell carved from a bone.

    Boreal Wind [Frostburn]
Evocation [Cold]

Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Effect: Gust of wind (20ft-wide, 20ft-high) emanating out from you to the extreme of the range
Duration: 1 round + 1 round / 2 levels
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a strong blast of arctic air that originates from your fingertips and moves in the direction you are facing. As a stronger form of gust of wind, this boreal wind automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar protected or unprotected flames, including lanterns. Large fires (such as bonfires, a blacksmith's coals, or even a house fire) have a 50% chance to be extinguished by the boreal wind. Forest or grassland fires are too large to be extinguished by this spell.
    All creatures caught in the area take 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the gust's effects. Those that fail the save are pushed away from the caster a distance of 3 feet per caster level. Creatures that remain in the area past the first round must make an additional saving throw each round.
    A boreal wind can do anything a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, overturn tents and blow down small huts, scuttle a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of the range.
    The wind can change direction if you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely blows in the same direction.

    Brain Slave of Ilsensine [Dragon #342 (pg 75)]
Conjuration (Summoning)
Level: Anagakok 6, Ancestral Speaker 6, Arcane Disciple 6, Archivist 6, Aspirant 6, Beholder Mage 6, Benevolent 6, Cleric 6, Crusader (base) 6, Deathwalker 6, Evangelist 6, Favored Soul 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Mystic 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Ur-Priest 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One or more summoned disembodied brains
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)
Spell Resistance: No
    A glowing, floating green brain with two tentacles, similar in appearance to a miniature avatar of Ilsensine, appears and circles about you. At any time during this spell's duration you can command this brain to attack a Small, Medium, or Large creature in order to extract its brain. The brain slave gets two attacks made at your base attack bonus, and has a +6 grapple bonus. If it hits with either of its attacks, it causes no damage but can immediately attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold and attaches the tentacle to its opponent's head. If neither tentacle is able to grapple the brain slave vanishes.
    If the brain slave of Ilsensine begins its turn with one of its tentacles attached, it can try to attach the other with a single grapple check (without making an attack roll). The opponent can escape with a single successful opposed grapple check or an Escape Artist check, but the brain slave gets a +2 circumstance bonus on its opposed check. Completely detaching a brain slave causes it to vanish.
    A brain slave of Ilsensine that begins its turn with both tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple check automatically extracts the opponent's brain, instantly killing the target. This power is useless against constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, or creatures of greater than Large size. It is not instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads.
    You can summon an additional brain slave of Ilsensine per 2 caster levels.
    Arcane Material Component: A small portion of brain from a humanoid or monstrous humanoid.

    Breathball [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Miirym]
Evocation [See Text]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 full-round action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Effect: 5-ft.-radius sphere of wind
Duration: 1 round/level or until discharged, whichever comes first
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a 5-foot-radius sphere of opaque cloudy wind. This sphere persists for up to 1 round/level, after which it discharges. It also discharges if you will it to (a standard action) or a creature other than you touches it. When discharged, the sphere explodes in a 20-foot burst. The burst duplicates the effects of any breath weapon you may employ (chosen at the time of casting), provided that the breath deals damage or resembles a spell effect of 6th-level or lower. It does not use your breath weapon, or prevent or delay you from using it. Breath weapons that deal damage cannot exceed 90 points (the normal limit for 6th-level arcane spells). The normal saving throw applies for the breath weapon, though it uses the spell DC instead of its original DC.
    The windy sphere has no effect other than to provide concealment as if it were a fog cloud. It does not affect missile weapons (unlike wind wall), knock over or hold at bay creatures (unlike gust of wind) or any other wind- or air-based effects.
    Casters who do not naturally have breath weapons must research a way to link an available spell to this one (usually with a custom spell or metamagic feat), otherwise the detonation has no effect.
    This spell has the appropriate descriptions for the breath weapon the sphere releases. For example, if used to release a fire breath weapon, this spell has the fire subtype.

    Bright Worms [Player's Handbook II]
Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Area: 20ft-radius spread
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: No
    With a loud pop, a nest of writhing worms of multicolored light appears in the air.
    You create a knot of living light with wormlike tendrils extending out from the mass. The worms hang in the air as if suspended. The worms drift away from the paths of your allies, but they attack enemies that enter the area, lashing out with lightning speed and combusting creatures that they touch.
    When you cast the spell, and in each later round at the beginning of your turn, the flaming worms deal 2d6 points of fire damage to any of your enemies in the area. The fire damage increases as you gain levels, to 3d6 per round for an 11th-level caster and 4d6 per round for a 15th-level caster.
    Any area spell that deals cold damage eliminates the bright worms from its area.

Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
    You utter your own truename, weaving its power into a matrix of force-tentacles that shimmer briefly, then descend around your form.
    A faintly glowing silvery field of force surrounds you, providing you with a +6 armor bonus to Armor Class.
    Unlike mundane armor, the bulwark of reality entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure change, or speed reduction. Because the bulwark of reality is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
    Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak your own personal truename.

A successful Reflex save halves this damage. A thin halo of flames surrounds the target for the remainder of the spell's duration. The flames deal no damage, but they inspire great hatred in you and your allies when looking at the target. You and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus on all attack and damage rolls against the target for the duration of the spell.

Target: Weapon touched
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    By chopping your hand like an axe and uttering the last few phrases of the spell, you cause the weapon you've touched to become wreathed in flickering blue flames.
    The flames from this spell shed azure light out to 30 feet. These flames do not harm the weapon or its wielder, but for the duration of the spell, it delivers fire damage in addition to its normal damage.
    The enchanted weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Also, on a critical hit, the weapon deals additional fire damage based on the weapon's critical multiplier:
        Critical        Additional

Target: One creature
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    A small but extremely loud bee appears, buzzing around the head of the designated target.
    This spell creates an unnerving noise that disrupts the subject's concentration. The subject is distracted and takes a -10 penalty on Move Silently checks. Creatures that can't hear are not distracted. The DC of Concentration checks to cast spells or maintain concentration while distracted is equal to this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast.
    The bee has a fly speed of 180 feet (perfect). It remains near the subject in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorph, cover, concealment, or any other attempt at disguising or hiding. The bee remains until the spell's duration expires or the subject moves out of range.
    The bee can't be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
    Material Component: A dab of honey.

Area: 20ft-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half

    You cause a burst of low, discordant noise to erupt at the chosen location. It deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the area.
    Cacophonic burst cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 ft.
Area: 10ft-radius emanation centered on you
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Your words speed into a jumble of sounds that mix together until only a constant, faint buzzing sound remains.
    You create a barrier of sonic energy at a distance of 10 feet from yourself. Creatures on either side of the barrier hear it as a loud but harmless buzzing. Nonmagical sound (including sound produced by a thunderstone) does not cross the barrier. Supernatural or spell-based sounds or sonic effects penetrate the barrier only if the caster or originator of the effect succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level).
    A creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The sonic vibrations create a 20% miss chance for any missiles (including siege weapon attacks) crossing the barrier in either direction. The barrier moves with you, but you cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by moving adjacent to an enemy). If you force a creature to pass through, the barrier has no effect on that creature.

Effect: One twilight guardian
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The very ground erupts in a show of stone and dirt, accompanied by a thunderclap. Standing in the center of the damaged ground is a creature of stone, wood, and plant parts resembling the regal form of a guardian dragon.
    This spell summons one twilight guardian (see page 121) to fight for you. The spell functions like a summon nature's ally spell, but with one exception. At any time, a summoned twilight guardian can sacrifice itself by simply touching you (a standard action); the twilight guardian is immediately destroyed, and you gain a number of hit points equal to one-half the twilight guardian's remaining hit points before its sacrifice.
    Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Effect: Summoned Tsuno spirit
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    One of the minor spells that allow the Tsuno to cross between the Spirit realms, this spell summons another Tsuno to fight beside you. The size of the Tsuno summoned depends on your caster level, though the spell may be cast on a specific Tsuno earlier in the same day with the intent to cast the spell again that day to summon that same target. If cast in this manner, the spell has a 10% + 5% chance per caster level of successfully summoning the named target. Failure means the casting has no effect, though another attempt may be made.
        Caster Level    Tsuno HD
        1-6     7
        7-10        9

        15-19       16
        20+     21
    The summoning is imperfect, and you must maintain full concentration for the duration of this spell or the summoned Tsuno returns from whence it was summoned.

    You speak the words and spread your palm open, as if you were throwing jacks. Coppery sparks spring from your palm, filling the corridor with small four-pronged spikes.
    A caltrops spell covers one 5ft-by-5ft square with caltrops. Every time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.
    A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one-half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.
    The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.
    For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5ft-by-5ft square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1. Thus, you affect two squares at 3rd level (+1 melee), three at 5th level (+2 melee), four at 7th level (+3 melee), and a maximum of five at 9th level or higher (+4 melee maximum).
    Multiple caltrops spells (or mundane caltrops) occupying the same space have no additional effect.

Components: V, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You cause an object to glow like a candle, shedding light in a 5-foot radius from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object if desired. The light produced by this cantrip is not strong enough to counter or dispel any magical darkness.
    Invented by the elves for use in nighttime ceremonies, candlelight has made its way into common usage. It is particularly useful to novices and apprentices who need to spend long hours in study.
    Arcane Material Component: A tiny candle.

    Capricious Zephyr [Dragon #314 (pg 38), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Air]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Druid 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Master of the South Wind 3, Metal Master 3, Sha'ir 3, Shaman (Kalamar) 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Spirit Shaman 3, Wild Reaper 3, Wind Walker 3, Winter Warden 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: 5ft-diameter sphere
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None or Reflex partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Blowing on your twirling hand, you complete the spell, creating a roiling ball of dust and gale-force winds.
    A ball of swirling wind and dust moves as you direct it, pushing your foes across the battlefield. From its starting point, a capricious zephyr moves 30 feet per round in the direction you point, regardless of the presence or absence of terrain.
    If the sphere enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for that round and tries to bowl over the creature with its wind force. That creature must resist a bull rush attack from the capricious zephyr, which has a +6 bonus on the check. If the spell wins the bull rush, it pushes the creature as far as it can in a random direction (roll 1d8; 1 indicates a push into the square closest to you, and 2 through 8 indicate the other squares, moving clockwise around the creature). Any creature pushed by the sphere must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
    A capricious zephyr moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you). Otherwise, it merely stays at rest and attempts to bowl over anyone in its square. The spell ends if the distance between the sphere and you ever exceeds the spell's range.

    Carrion Swarm [Warcraft (pg 160)]
Conjuration (Summoning)
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Area: Cone
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A swarm of bats, poisonous spiders, flying beetles, and other such vermin extend out from the caster's hand to create a cone-shaped area of effect.
    This swarm of vermin causes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). The swarm's attacks are nonmagical. Creatures that are immune to poison take half damage (one quarter with a successful saving throw). Damage reduction or being incorporeal makes a creature immune to damage from carrion swarm.
    Material Component: A dead beetle, spider, or other vermin.

    Caustic Disdain [Dragon #347 (pg 77)]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You encase one target in a field of acidic vapor. The field deals 1d6 points of acid damage each round, with a single Fortitude save for half damage for the duration.. The aura of acid lingers around the target, causing a foul odor, making its appearance haggard and unkempt, and magically dampening the enthusiasm of characters wishing to help the target.
    Any creature wishing to cast a harmless spell on the target during the duration of the spell, must make a Will save. On a failed save, the spell fails and the caster loses the spell and that part of their action. A caster may make a save each time casts a spell. If he succeeds, he does not have to make a save to cast a spell on the target creature for the duration of the spell. This does not prevent the creature from being affecting by area-effect spells.

    Celestial Brilliance [Book of Exalted Deeds]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 1 day / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The object touched sheds light brighter than bright sunlight, channeled directly from the celestial realms. The light extends to a 120-foot radius: bright light to 60 feet and dim light in another 60 feet.
    Creatures with light sensitivity take twice the usual penalty when they are within 60 feet of the object. Undead creatures take 1d6 points of damage each round they are within the bright light. Evil outsiders, as well as undead creatures that are specifically harmed by sunlight, take 2d6 points of damage each round in the bright light.
    Celestial brilliance brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
    Celestial brilliance counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as deeper darkness.

    Chain Lightning [Diablo 2 (pg 37), Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Air Domain 6, Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Duskblade 5, Fleshcrafter 6, Moshi School 7, Sha'ir 6, Shaman (Warcraft) 6, Sorcerer 6, Sorceress 4, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Tempest Domain 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Target: One primary target plus one secondary target/level (each must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.
    The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) on the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as many dice of damage as the primary one did (rounded down). For example, a 19th level sorcerer generates a primary bolt (19d6 points of damage) and as many as 19 secondary bolts (each of which deals half as much damage as the primary bolt dealt). Each subject can attempt Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
    Focus: A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and one silver pin for each of your caster levels.

    Chain Missile [Dragon #323 (pg 78), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400ft + 40ft / level)
Target: One creature, plus one more creature / 2 levels (each of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Bolts of pale blue energy spring forth from your finger and slam into the desired target. An instant later, the bolts bounce away toward other creatures, slamming into each one.
    Missiles of magical energy dart from your fingertip to unerringly strike a creature. The missiles strike one creature initially, then spring to other targets. Each missile deals 1d4+1 points of force damage. One missile strikes the primary target per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten missiles (dealing 10d4+10 points of damage). After the missiles strike, they ricochet to a number of targets up to the number of missiles created by the spell. Each secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of damage, as if struck by a single magic missile. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no secondary target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Missiles without a secondary target do not ricochet off the primary target.
    Spells, magic items, and abilities that protect against magic missile (such as the shield spell or a brooch of shielding) also protect against this spell. If the primary target has that sort of protection, the spell has no effect against it but still springs to all secondary targets. (A brooch of shielding loses a number of charges equal to the number of missiles hitting the creature-up to ten missiles.) If spell resistance causes the spell to fail to harm the primary target, the spell fails and missiles do not ricochet to additional targets.
    The missiles strike unerringly, even if the targets are in melee or have anything less then total cover or concealment. You cannot single out specific parts of a creature to strike. This spell cannot target or damage inanimate objects.

    A sphere of fiery energy comes into being before you. You channel energy into it, causing it to bubble and seethe with power. When you have poured enough energy into the sphere, you send it flying into your foes.
    This spell creates a bolt of fiery energy that blasts your enemies. The spell's strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.

    You channel energy into the shimmering waves of sound spell, causing them to tremble and quake with power. When you have poured enough energy into the spell, you send a thunderous blast into your foes.
    This spell creates a cone of sonic energy that blasts your enemies. The spell's strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.
    If you cast channeled sound burst as a swift action, it deals ld4 points of sonic damage per two levels in a 15-foot cone.
    If you cast the spell as a standard action, it deals ld6 points of sonic damage per level in a 30-foot cone.
    If you cast channeled sound burst as a full-round action, it deals ld8 points of sonic damage per level in a 30-foot cone.
    If you spend 2 full rounds casting this spell, it deals 1d10 points of sonic damage per level in a 60-foot-radius spread and permanently deafens all creatures in the area that fail Fortitude saves. The caster is unaffected by the spell's effects.
    Regardless of how long you spend casting this spell, it can't deal more than 10 dice of damage. When you begin casting this spell, you decide when you are finished casting it after the appropriate time has passed. You do not need to declare ahead of time how long you want to spend casting the spell.

Each knot discharges into a randomly selected creature in the area and deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 5d4 points. A creature won't be hit by more than one bolt-extra bolts that randomly hit the same creature dissipate harmlessly instead. A Reflex save is allowed for half damage.

    Choking Claw [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Balagos]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: 10-ft. hand
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Choking claw creates a Large magic hand in the form of a black, taloned claw that moves and attacks as directed by you. (You direct it as a free action). The floating hand can move up to 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively), +7 for the hand's Strength score (25), -1 for being Large. The hand's damage is 1d8+7. The hand cannot stun, grapple, or bull rush.
    This floating, disembodied claw is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you when undamaged and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys the hand.
    By concentrating (as a standard action), you can designate a new opponent for the hand.
    Focus: The taloned claw of some beast.

If you hit, the rod releases a brilliant flash, stunning the target for 1 round unless it makes a Will save (DC 15). If the rod leaves your hand or the spell duration expires, it disappears.
    Material Component: A glass rod.

Afterward, the lights return to normal. Sighless creatures are unaffected.
    The spell only functions if at least four active artificial light sources (torches, lanterns, light spells, and so forth) are within 60 feet of the caster. The spell's name refers to its most common use (in well-lit city streets), but it can function in any area with sufficient lighting.

Effect: One or more sets of clothes
Duration: 1 hour / level (D); see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    When you and your companions need to attend a gala reception at the last minute, you need not despair over your clothing. When you cast clothier's closet, you conjure a 3-inch-diameter wooden rod up to 10 feet long between any two upright supports you choose. For example, you could summon the rod to appear between two walls of a corridor or alcove. On the rod hang a number of outfits as determined by you, each of a size and type you specify while the spell is cast.
    The conjured rod can hold a variety of separate outfits whose total price does not exceed 100 gp. The outfit types that you can specify include the following: artisan's outfit (1 gp), cleric's vestments (5 gp), cold weather outfit (8 gp), courtier's outfit (30 gp), entertainer's outfit (3 gp), explorer's outfit (10 gp), monk's outfit (5 gp), noble's outfit (75 gp), scholar's outfit (5 gp), or traveler's outfit (1 gp).
    The conjured clothing is normal in all respects and does not radiate magic. Even after the duration elapses and the rod and hangers disappear, the clothes remain.
    Special: A character with any Mark of Hospitality dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Ghallanda), can cast this spell without the material component, but the conjured clothes last only as long as the spell's duration.
    Material Component: A gem worth at least 100 gp.

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: A cloud in a 30 ft-radius and is 10 ft high
Duration: 1 hour / 2 levels (D)
Saving Throw: No
Spell Resistance: No
    A billowy cloud masses at a point you designate. The cloud is spongy but substantial, providing a solid surface upon which you can walk or climb (DC 10). The cloud remains stationary in all but severe winds (31+ mph), which move the cloud 25 ft per round.
    Material Component: A tuft of cotton or wool

    Cloudkill [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Death Master 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Maho-Tsukai 5, Sha'ir 5, Shugenja (Air) 6, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5, Yogo School 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Cloud spreads 20ft-radius, 20ft-high.
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud). A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.
    Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell. Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You bring forth a purple cloud of fog, taking those within it to the land of dreams.
    Creatures of 3 or fewer Hit Dice fall unconscious upon contact with the fumes without a saving throw. Creatures that have from 4 to 6 Hit Dice must make a Fortitude save or fall asleep for 5d6 rounds. Creatures that make their saving throw and all creatures above 6 HD that might be affected are exhausted for as long as they stay in the cloud. Cloudsleep moves away from you at 10 feet per round, so figure its new spread each round.

Target: One living creature
Duration: Concentration; see text
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a magic force that grips the subject's heart (or similar vital internal organ) and begins crushing it. The victim appears to be having a heart attack; he is paralyzed and takes 1d3 points of damage per round.
    In addition, a conscious victim gains a new saving throw each round to stop the spell. If the victim dies as a result of this spell, his chest ruptures and bursts, and his smoking heart appears in your hand.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: A ring of blades whirling around you.
Duration: 1 minute / level (D) or until expended
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No or Yes; see text
    A ring of flashing blades, composed entirely of glowing blue force, spins around you in a whirling dance of death.
    You surround yourself with a ring of spinning force blades. This spell creates one blade per three caster levels, up to a maximum of six blades at 18th level. You gain a shield bonus to AC equal to the number of blades that circle you. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect.
    Every round, as a move action, you can direct one of the blades to break off and strike any target within 30 feet. The blade strikes unerringly, requiring no attack roll, and deals 2d6 points of damage (even to incorporeal creatures) before disappearing. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Launching a blade in this fashion reduces your shield bonus accordingly.
    Any creature that grapples you is automatically struck by all the blades that still encircle you, which deal damage as normal but then disappear as though you had voluntarily launched them.

Those who fail fall prone and must immediately succeed on a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or slip off the column, taking commensurate falling damage.
    Creatures atop the column as it rises may be smashed against the ceiling or other overhead obstructions, which deals 4d6 points of damage.

Target: Touched creature or combustible object that weighs no more than 25 lbs / level
Duration: Instantaneous; see text

    This spell makes a combustible object or a creature's combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp.
    If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) with no saving throw. Further, the creature must make a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire (DMG 303).
    If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame deals fire damage to the object as noted above. The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire.
    Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.

    Conjure Lesser Midnight Construct [Magic of Incarnum]
Conjuration (Creation) [Incarnum]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M, Essentia
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One conjured midnight construct
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a single lesser midnight construct. The creature appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. As a free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The midnight construct acts normally on the last round of the spell's duration and dissipates at the end of its turn.
    Midnight constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit, using incarnum you coalesce. Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders or summoned creatures.
    Essentia: You can invest essentia in a midnight construct when you create it to gain one or more of the following modifications to the construct. Every point of essentia can be invested in any one modification.
    * Combat Power: +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per point of essentia invested.
    * Damage Reduction: Increase the construct's DR by 2 points per point of essentia invested.
    * Land Speed Increase: Increase the construct's land speed by 10 feet per point of essentia invested.
    Material Component: A bead of dark glass.

    Conjure Midnight Construct [Magic of Incarnum]
Conjuration (Creation) [Incarnum]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
    As conjure lesser midnight construct, except as noted above and as follows. You conjure a midnight construct instead of a lesser midnight construct.
    Essentia: In addition to the options listed for conjure lesser midnight construct, you gain two new options for modifying your midnight construct by investing essentia:
    * Fly Speed: Bestow a fly speed of 20 feet per point of essentia invested (40 feet for 2 points of essentia, 60 feet for 3 points, and so on).
    * Deadly Aura: Bestow a damaging aura. The aura deals 1d6 points of damage per point of essentia invested (Fort half, DC 10 + 1/2 construct's HD + essentia invested) to all creatures adjacent to the construct at the end of the construct's turn.

    Contagious Fog [Spell Compendium, Underdark]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Watery Death Domain 7, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: See text
    Spitting the last phrase of the spell, you throw out your arm, and a brown mist whirls into being around your foes.
    This spell functions like fog cloud (PH 232), except as noted here. Each round that a creature is within the fog, it must make a Fortitude save or contract a disease equivalent to the shakes (DMG 292), which strikes immediately (no incubation period). A creature afflicted with this disease takes 1d8 points of Dexterity damage immediately, and each day that the disease persists, it must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take another 1d8 points of Dexterity damage.
    The fog moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground or water. (Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new center, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.) Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the surface over which they move, pouring down sinkhole openings, and even down through minute cracks. Contagious fog cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.
    Material Component: A used handkerchief.

    Contingency [Player's Handbook]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Court Herald 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Shugenja (Water) 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Time Domain 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M, F
Casting Time: At least 10 minutes; see text
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: One day / level (D) or until discharged
    You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. The contingency spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10-minutes, use that instead.
    The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so forth) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
    The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might prescribe that any time you are plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the water breathing spell instantly comes into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time you fall more than 4 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
    You can only use one contingency spell at a time; if a second spell is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.
    Material Components: Those of the companion spell, plus quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin or similar spell-using creature.
    Focus: A statuette of you carved from elephant ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp). You must carry the focus for the contingency to work.

    Continual Darkness [Strength and Honor (pg 150), The Lost Tomb of Kruk-Ma-Kali (pg 83)]
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 5, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Beholder Mage 5, Benevolent 5, Cleric 5, Crusader (base) 5, Deathwalker 5, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Mystic 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Ur-Priest 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell causes the object touched to shed absolute darkness in a 60ft-radius for a very, very long time. Even a creature (such as a baatezu) able to see within the area of a deeper darkness cannot see while in the area of a continual darkness spell, unless its Hit Dice or level equals or exceeds that of the caster. Light-generating spells and effects must total six spell levels to counter the continual darkness, and even then the prevailing light conditions exist in that area until the light-generating spell's duration ends. Thus, a cleric would need two daylight spells, a sorcerer three, etc. Of course, the continual darkness is subject to a dispel magic, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check to end it.

    Continual Flame [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Light]
Level: Adept 3, Anagakok 2, Ancestral Speaker 3, Arcane Disciple 3, Archivist 3, Aspirant 3, Beholder Mage 2, Benevolent 3, Cleric 3, Crusader (base) 3, Deathwalker 2, Evangelist 3, Favored Soul 3, Flame Steward 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Healer (Warcraft) 3, Hunter of the Dead 2, Knight of the Chase 3, Merchant Prince 2, Mystic 3, Sha'ir 2, Shade Hunter 3, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Ur-Priest 3, Urban Adept 3, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Effect: Magical, heatless flame
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.
    Material Component: You sprinkle ruby dust (worth 50 gp) on the item that is to carry the flame.

    Corpse Candle [Complete Arcane, Spell Compendium, Tome and Blood]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3, Wu Jen (All) 3
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: Ghostly hand and candle
Duration: 1 minute / level (D); see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You hold out a piece of flesh before you, and as you concentrate on your desired spell effect, the flesh dissolves into nothingness. Nearby, in the place of your choosing, a severed hand appears bearing a lit candle.
    The ghostly hand carries a lit candle that sheds light in a 5-foot radius. You can move the hand at the beginning of your turn as you desire-forward or back, up or down, straight or around corners-up to 50 feet per round. Directing the candle is a free action. The hand and candle are incorporeal and can pass through objects. A corpse candle illuminates hidden, ethereal, and invisible beings and items, all of which become faintly visible as wispy outlines. Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but illuminated incorporeal and invisible creatures do not benefit from concealment, and so attacks against them suffer no miss chance.
    The hand cannot be attacked or damaged, though dispel magic and similar spells can dispel it. The hand winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
    Material Component: A piece of a corpse untreated by any kind of preservative.

    Corrosive Grasp [Magic of Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]
Level: Anagakok 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Gnome Artificer 1, Initiate of Ghaunadaur Feat 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creatures touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Your hand glistens and smokes from a viscous coating of acid. It does not harm you, but your opponents are less fortunate.
    A touch attack with this hand causes 1d8 points of acid damage. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level. You can also deal this damage as extra damage with an unarmed strike or an attack with a natural weapon. If you grapple an opponent, you can deal this damage in addition to other damage you deal with a successful grapple check.

    Crack Ice [Frostburn]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: 10ft-radius / level spread; or one ice creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes (creature only)
    You create a sudden explosive burst that shatters ice bridges, breaks up river ice, opens frozen ponds, or damages an icy creature. The ice broken covers a 10-foot radius per caster level, and a 1- foot depth per level. Ice thicker than the spell's depth is cracked and weakened, but not broken all the way through. Weakened ice is treated as one category thinner than it really is (see Table 1-2, page 11 of Frostburn).
    Creatures dropped from a bridge, through lake or river ice, or off a glacier or iceberg take normal falling and cold water damage. Creatures on a glacier will have a crevasse open under them equal to the depth of the spell.
    Targeted against an ice creature of any weight (such as an ice golem, winterspawn, or entombed), crack ice deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.
    Material Component: A hammer carved from salt crystal (50 gp).

    Crackling Sphere [Dragonlance Campaign Setting]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Area: 3ft-radius sphere
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A crackling globe of electricity flies in whichever direction you point, electrocuting those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round, though if it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d4 points of electricity damage for every two levels of the spellcaster (maximum 5d4). (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.)
    The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and crackles. The surface of the sphere is yielding, so does not cause damage except from the electricity. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell range.

    Create Ectoplasm [Ghostwalk]
Conjuration (Creation) [Ectomancy]
Level: Anagakok 1, Ancestral Speaker 1, Arcane Disciple 1, Archivist 1, Aspirant 1, Beholder Mage 1, Benevolent 1, Cleric 1, Crusader (base) 1, Deathwalker 1, Evangelist 1, Favored Soul 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Knight of the Chase 1, Mystic 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Ur-Priest 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Effect: 1 lb. of raw ectoplasm / level
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create raw ectoplasm. The ectoplasm forms from your hands, eyes, or mouth, and may be pale gray, light blue, light green, or pale yellow. You may create sticky or slippery ectoplasm. The ectoplasm does not vanish until the spell duration has expired, but if the spell is dispelled and the ectoplasm has been in existence for more than 10 minutes, it vanishes instantly.

    Create Fetch [Complete Scoundrel]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Assassin 3, Bard 3, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Divine Bard 3, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Vigilante 3, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Effect: A duplicate of yourself
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Plucking out one of your own hairs, you make a beckoning motion. A double of you appears nearby.
    You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell. Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless, but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you. The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does. You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.
    The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' Spot checks as normal. Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature. The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess. A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise. Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.
    At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending. The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained. It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range. You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn. It can perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance-for example, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.
    The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices. Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human of 20 feet for a halfling). Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.
    The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it. If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.
    A Medium-sized fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift up to 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds. A Large or Small creature's fetch has the same strength but different carrying capacity and drag capacity. Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier). If gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class. It has no Constitution score and has 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. If can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points. The fetech has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.
    The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. Even if armed, it doesn't threaten an area around it and thus can't flank an enemy, nor can it use the aid another action to improve your Armor Class or attack rolls.
    The fetch has the same alignment aura as you do. Detect thoughts does not register its existence (since it has no Intelligence), but detect magic reveals it as a magical effect.
    Material Component: One of your own hairs.

    Create Magic Tattoo [Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Player's Guide to Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M, F
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 24 hours
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    You finish the last detail and lean back to look at your work. The tattoo looks good. It should prove useful.
    This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo-at least 1 rank of Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligraphy), or a similar Craft skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful Craft check. The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below.
    If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects (Craft DC 10).
    * +2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will).
    * +1 luck bonus on attack rolls.
    * +1 deflection bonus to AC.
    At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe (Craft DC 15).
    * +2 resistance bonus on saving throws.
    * +2 competence bonus on attack rolls.
    When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe (Craft DC 20).
    * Spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 per three caster levels.
    * +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score.
    * +1 spellcaster level. This effect increases the subject's effective level, but not the total number of spells. For example, an 11th-level caster who receives this tattoo functions as a 12th-level caster for the purpose of determining level-based spell variables (such as range, area, effect, and so on), but he does not receive any extra spells.
    A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails.
    A successful erase spell removes a single magic tattoo. A successful dispel magic spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing them.
    Material Components: Tattoo inks in appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp.
    Focus: Tattoo needles.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: One battleground obstacle; see text
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    A single, usable "background element" springs forth from the ground at the spot you determine. It can be anything from a large rock to a crude stairway, as long as it does not exceed 10 feet x 10 feet. This battleground obstacle provides higher ground, can be used as cover, a hiding spot, and so forth. The obstacle abruptly sinks in the ground when the spell duration ends, leaving no trace of its existence.
    Example of obstacles you can create with this spell include: stairs, elevated platforms, archways, rocky formations, fountains, wells, trenches, columns, and so on. Fountains and wells only have water if a water source already exists at that location (DM's call).

    Crushing Grip [Player's Handbook II]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 3 rounds
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You conjure a band of energy that slowly squeezes your opponent. As the band tightens, it restricts his movement and eventually holds him in place, rigid with paralysis.
    This spell has one effect on an opponent when you begin casting it. At the beginning of your next turn, when you finish casting the spell, it has a second effect. When you start casting this spell, your target takes a -2 penalty on attacks, checks, saves, and AC. He also takes a 20-foot penalty to speed. This effect does not allow a saving throw, but spell resistance applies. If you fail to overcome the target's spell resistance, you immediately stop casting the spell, and the secondary effect does not take place.
    When you complete the casting of this spell, your target must make a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed. Even if the target makes this saving throw, this spell's initial effect continues to affect him for the spell's duration.
    This spell's duration begins after you have completed casting it.

Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a creature
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The target of your spell is visibly restricted, unable to move freely as a shimmering sphere surrounds it.
    This spell functions like Otiluke's resilient sphere (PH 258), except that the sphere painfully constricts the target, hampering her movements and breathing. The target is entangled and takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage per round as the sphere contracts. If the target is rendered unconscious, any remaining damage from the crushing sphere is lethal damage.
    Material Component: An eggshell, which is crushed as the spell is cast.

    Cyclonic Blast [Dragon #314 (pg 38), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Air]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Master of the South Wind 4, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 120 ft.
Area: 120-ft. line
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Cupping a child's top, you forcefully thrust your hand forward, simultaneously speaking the final words of the spell's proscribed formula. Immediately thereafter, a blast of whirling wind issues forth from your outstretched fingers, sweeping up within it all who stand in its way.
    You send a twisting torrent of wind, not unlike a tornado turned on its side, toward your enemies. A cyclonic blast deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all creatures and objects in the area. Objects bigger than Large take half damage. The cyclonic blast begins at your fingertips.
    Creatures who fail their Reflex saving throws against a cyclonic blast are additionally in danger of being knocked back by the force of the wind. Treat this as a bull rush attack made with a +12 bonus on the Strength check. The cyclonic blast always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and (unlike a normal bull rush) you can exceed your normal movement limit with a sufficiently high check result. Airborne creatures are treated as if they were one size category smaller for the purpose of resisting the bull rush.
    If the damage caused to an interposing barrier by the blast shatters or breaks through it, the cyclonic blast can continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
    Focus: A child's spinning top.

Area: One lightning-lance / five levels (maximum three)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a crackling lance of lightning that you can hurl at your foes. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack roll to hit. The lance deals 3d6 points of damage from the impact, plus 1d6 electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The impact damage is not subject to being reduced by protection from elements (electricity), spark shield, and similar magic or effects, but the target is entitled to a Fortitude save to halve the electricity damage.
    You can create and hurl a second lightning lance at 10th-level, and a third at 15th-level. All bolts must be aimed at enemies within 30 feet of each other.
    Material Component: An amber, crystal, or glass rod.

Saving Throw: None and Reflex half; see text
    This spell functions similarly to Evard's black tentacles, except that the tentacles are limned in blue-white fire. Every creature within the area of the spell takes 1 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15 points) each round. A successful Reflex save halves this damage, but a character grappled by the tentacles cannot make the save.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Light dies, and evil blossoms in the tenebrous heart of nothing.
    This spell is similar to darkness (PH 217), except that those within its area also take damage. Creatures of good alignment take 2d6 points of damage per round while in the spell's area, and creatures that are neither good nor evil take 1d6 points of damage per round. Like darkness, the area of damning darkness has a radius of 20 feet. If the spell is cast on a small object, its effect (including damage) can be blocked by concealing the object within a lightproof covering.
    Damning darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level.
    Arcane Material Component: A dollop of pitch with a tiny needle hidden inside it.

The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other, but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet a round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
    Dancing lights can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

    This spell creates a burst of magical energy that deals 1d6 points per level of nonlethal damage (maximum 10d6). Further, evil creatures that fail their saving throw become entangled by lingering threads of magical energy for 1d6 rounds. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity; the entangled target can move at half speed but can't run or charge. An entangled creature that attempts to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check or lose the spell. This spell affects only creatures-objects are unharmed.
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of spider's web.

Effect: One ray / 2 levels (maximum 7 rays)
Duration: Instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    With a quick invocation to your deity, you call forth a nimbus of jet-black night. This terrible radiance, laced with the will of your deity, allows you to shoot black bolts of power.
    You unleash beams of darkness from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. You can hurl one bolt for every two caster levels you have (maximum seven bolts). You can hurl all the bolts at once, or you can hurl one bolt per round as a free action, starting in the round when you cast the spell. You do not have to hurl a bolt in every round, but if you don't hurl the bolt you were entitled to in a round, it is lost. If you hurl all the bolts at once, all your targets must be within 60 feet of each other.
    A darkbolt deals 2d8 points of damage to a living creature, and the creature is dazed for 1 round unless it makes a Will save (a creature struck by multiple bolts during the same round is dazed for a maximum of 1 round, no matter how many times it fails its save). An undead creature takes no damage, but is dazed if it fails its save.

Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 1, Assassin 2, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: One creature or object touched
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The caster makes one creature or object radiate special darkness called darklight in a 5ft-sphere. This spell is mostly useful in a large, naturally dark area. Within the darklight area sphere, creatures that can normally see in the light can see, even though there is no light. Only creatures and objects in the sphere can be seen, and only creatures in the sphere can see within the sphere, unless other observers can naturally see in the dark. Thus, while two creatures can see each other, a creature standing outside the sphere can neither see the creature in the sphere (assuming it doesn't have darkvision), or can it be seen by them. A creature with darkvision standing outside the sphere could see those within the sphere, but those inside could not discern the creature.
    The darklight spell's sphere is invisible in normal light and does not function in magical darkness.

Components: V, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 10 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20% miss chance). Even creatures who can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level (such as light, or dancing lights). Higher-level light spells (such as daylight) are not affected by darkness.
    If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.
    Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
    Arcane Material Components: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.

Any airborne vapors, fumes, clouds, smoke, and gases drift away from the point at a speed of 80 feet per round and dissipate in one-fourth the normal time.
    In addition to the above effects, the cooling breeze can do anything that a normal breeze would be expected to do. It can move wind chimes, scatter pieces of paper or parchment, cause candle or hearth flames to flicker, and so forth.

    A globe of brilliant radiance erupts silently, as though the light of dawn had arisen.
    All creatures in the area glow with light equivalent to a torch for the duration of the spell, making hiding difficult and even revealing the location of invisible creatures. (Invisible creatures are still considered to have concealment.)
    In addition, undead and creatures within the area that have light sensitivity or light blindness take ld6 points of damage, +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +5). A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 10 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures who take penalties in bright light suffer them while within the radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light (such as vampires). If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
    Daylight brought into an area of deeper darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
    Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.

Target: One creature
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell causes the subject to explode into flames. After the caster concentrates for 1d3 rounds, the subject's skin begins to blister, and she takes 1d3 points of damage. The next round, she takes 1d6 points of damage. On the third and subsequent rounds, she bursts into flames and takes 1d10 points of damage per round. The stench of burning hair and flesh is overwhelming. No conventional means of extinguishing the flames is helpful, since she is burning from the inside out. The only way to stop the spell is to ruin the concentration for the caster (say, with a physical attack) before the subject dies.

Range: 0 feet
Effect: Quarterstaff of force
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You conjure into existence a quarterstaff of force, approximately 8 feet long and 2 inches in diameter. The decastave lasts only so long as you keep it in hand; if you give it to another character or drop it, it vanishes. (You can cast other spells with somatic components by holding the staff in one hand.)
    You can use the decastave in combat to strike with a melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage per hit. Since the decastave is made of force, it affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally (provided you can see such creatures). The decastave possesses the thundering weapon ability and deals 1d8 points of bonus sonic damage on a critical hit. Subjects dealt a critical hit by the decastave must also succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be deafened permanently.
    Material Component: a slender wand of duskwood.

    You let out a quick cry and instantly feel your chest swell with air, as if you had taken a deep breath. Strangely, you feel no need to exhale.
    Your lungs instantly fill with air, and continue to refill with air for the duration of the spell. When the spell's duration expires, you can continue to hold your breath as if you had just gulped down a lungful of air.
    You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself from drowning after being suddenly plunged into water.

Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: 2ft-radius sphere
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    From the pearl you hold between your thumb and ring finger erupts a cloudy gray sphere of whirling air and howling wind that flies to attack your enemies.
    When you cast this spell, you create a violently swirling sphere of air. As a move action, you can make the sphere travel up to 30 feet per round and strike a creature or object you indicate as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by the sphere takes 3d6 points of damage from the force of its winds. In addition, Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Creatures that fall prone must then succeed on a second Fortitude save or be swept up by the sphere and driven 1d8◊10 feet into the air, dropping 1d6 squares from their original position in a random direction and taking falling damage as normal. If a window is within range, the subject is automatically thrown in that direction.
    If some obstacle prevents the subject creature from reaching its expelled height, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet of movement it was unable to complete, so that a creature hurled 50 feet up in a room with a 20-foot ceiling would take 3d6 points of damage from the impact, then take 2d6 points of damage when it falls back to the ground.
    The sphere can affect a maximum of one creature or object per round, and winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
    Focus: A gray pearl worth at least 100 gp.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: 20 ft-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This sadistic spell draws any creature in the affected area, down into the sand. This leaves the creatures buried up to their heads, exposed for the sun and scavengers to wreck havoc upon the victims. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save, those that fail their save are sucked into the ground. For most living creatures, this means being buried up to their necks. Creatures are never buried in a manner that prevents them from breathing.
    Once a creature is buried by this spell, it is rendered helpless, unless it can succeed a Strength or Escape Artist check (DC 15 +1 per 2 caster levels), as a full-round action. Spellcaster cannot cast spells with somatic or material  components, unless the material component is already in hand. Creatures not affected by this spell can attempt to aid another creature trying to escape.
    This spell can only affect loose earth, such as, dirt, mud, and sand. Particularly cruel spellcasters cast this spell on creatures that are in shallow water, in an area with tiny carnivorous vermin, or even use this spell and then cast transmute mud to rock.
    Material Component: A paper funnel and a handful of dirt, mud, or sand.

    Disarm [FR- Magic Books of Faerun- Guidebook of the Watchful Order]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One object up to 50 pounds
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None (see text)
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a ram-like force that can strike with considerable power against an object, whether unattended or held by a creature. If the target is an unattended object, the force knocks the object in a direction of your choice, with the maximum distance determined by the following table:
        Object Weight   Maximum Distance
        0-5 pounds      40 ft.
        6-10 pounds 30 ft.
        11-20 pounds    20 ft.
        21-30 pounds    10 ft
        31-50 pounds    5 ft.
    If the target object is held by a creature, you initiate a disarm attempt against the creature holding the object. The creature does not get an attack of opportunity against you or the force. You and the target then make opposed attack rolls; your attack bonus is equal to your caster level plus your Int bonus or Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively). The force is treated as a one-handed weapon wielded by a Medium creature. If you win the opposed roll, the target is disarmed and the object is knocked in a direction of your choice as if it were an unattended object (see above). If you lose the opposed roll, the target does not get an opportunity to disarm you.

    Disk of Concordant Opposition [Dragon #338 (pg 48)]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 5, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Beholder Mage 5, Benevolent 5, Boccob Deity 5, Crusader (base) 5, Deathwalker 5, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Mystic 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Ur-Priest 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: Disk of energy
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The caster hurls a hand-sized disk of interwoven positive and negative energy, a lesser form of Boccob's own power with this name. The caster must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the disk takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). A creature that makes a successful Fortitude save takes half damage. If the damage reduces the target to 0 hit points or below, it is disintegrated.
    When used against an object, the disk disintegrates as much as one 5 foot-cube of non-living matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of very large objects or structures targeted. The disk even affects objects constructed of force, such as wall of force, as long as the caster's level equals or exceeds the caster level of the force effect, but the disk cannot effect globe of invulnerability, antimagic field, or similar spells.
    Half of the damage is positive energy and the other half is negative energy. Unlike the negative damage from inflict light wounds, this negative energy damage does not heal undead creatures, nor does the positive energy heal living creatures.
    Only the first creature or object struck is affected, the disk affects only one target per casting.
    Material Component: A small iron and electrum wheel with a rod rising from the center of one side.

    Distracting Shadows [Magic of Eberron]
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 1, Bard 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Divine Bard 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Vigilante 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 24 hours (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell causes an object to radiate distracting shadows in a 10-foot-radius spread. Casual scrutiny of an affected area doesn't reveal anything out of the ordinary; however, cracks, crannies, corners, hidden traps, and secret entrances or exits within the area become harder to spot.
    Creatures within the area or looking into it are subliminally confused by the distracting shadows, and take a -5 penalty on all Spot and Search checks. However, the shadows do not provide sufficient concealment for a creature to make a Hide check.
    Distracting shadows counters or dispels any light or darkness spell of equal or lower level.
    Distracting shadows can be made permanent with a permanency spell (minimum caster level 10th; cost 1,000 XP).
    Special: A character with any Mark of Shadow dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Phiarlan or Thuranni), can cast this spell to fill a 20-foot-radius spread.
    Material Component: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.

    Dolor [Dragon #336 (pg 78)]
Evocation [Evil]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 24 hours
    The caster draws from the power of a planar binding to imbue his words with great arcane power, causing pain to creatures caught within. This spell has no effect on creatures not caught in the caster's planar binding. Because the his voice causes captured creatures strong discomfort, he gains a bonus to all opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature to perform a service. This bonus is +1 per three caster levels.
    Using dolor has two risks. First, the creature compel to perform a service, is more likely to maliciously corrupt the intent of the commands and later seek revenge. Secondly, because this spell ties the caster more to the planar binding, if the result of the caster's opposed Charisma check is a natural 1, not only does the creature escape, but the caster is then automatically affected as if the creature had cast charm monster, for a number of rounds equal to the creature's Hit Dice.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates a small, localized wall of earth, which rises from the ground. You create one wall section 5-feet long, 5-feet tall, and 1-foot thick per level. For example, a 7th-level caster could create a wall 5-feet tall and 1-foot thick that was 20-feet long and then turned and continued another 15 feet.
    The earthen shield cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The earthen shield must be vertical and must rest upon a firm foundation, merging with existing earth. You can make the wall up to 10 feet tall by stacking one section on top of another, but that is the maximum height the earthen shield can reach. You can make the wall two or more feet thick by stacking one section behind another.
    The earthen shield is defensive in nature, used to provide cover from attackers. Each 5-foot length of the shield has 100 hit points per foot of thickness. Creatures can hit the shield automatically, and its hardness is 0. a section of this whose hit points drop to 0 is breaches. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single effort, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 5 per foot of thickness (on a successful check, a 5-foot section of the wall is destroyed). The earthen shield requires a DC 15 Climb check.

Saving Throw: Special
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a sword composed of raw focused energy, which you can wield to devastating effect. An elemental blade may be created with the acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic descriptors, which correspond with the appropriate type of energy damage. This type cannot be changed once the spell is cast. Attacks with the elemental blade are normal melee attacks, although since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
    The effect the elemental blade has upon target creatures varies, depending upon the type of blade.
    Fire: This elemental blade is a nimbus of crackling red and yellow flame. It is wielded like a scimitar, and deals 2d6 points of fire damage plus one point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +10). Victims must also make a Reflex save to avoid catching on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Non-magical combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth ignite if they are struck (no save).
    Cold: This elemental blade is a nimbus of pale blue-white cold. It is wielded like a rapier, and deals 2d6 points of cold damage plus one point of cold damage per caster level (maximum +10). Victims must make a Fortitude save or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to the caster's spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, mystics and druids, Charisma for sorcerers).
    Electricity: This elemental blade is a nimbus of blue-violet electricity. It is wielded like a longsword and deals 2d6 points of electricity damage plus one point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum +10). Victims must make a Reflex save or fall prone and be dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the caster's spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, mystics and druids, Charisma for sorcerers).
    Acid: This elemental blade is a corrosive stream of green-black acid. It is wielded like a scimitar, and deals 2d6 points of acid damage plus one point of acid damage per caster level (maximum +10). Victims must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for a number of rounds equal to the caster's spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, mystics and druids, Charisma for sorcerers).
    Sonic: This elemental blade is a nimbus of pinkish-white force. It is wielded like a longsword, and deals 1d10 points of sonic damage plus one point of sonic damage per caster level (maximum +10). Victims must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for a number of rounds equal to the caster's spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, mystics and druids, Charisma for sorcerers).
    If an attacked creature possesses spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the elemental blade strikes it. If the blade is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal, full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
    Focus: A miniature sword with a blade made of clear quartz. It costs 25 stl to construct.

    Elemental Dart [Dragonlance Campaign Setting]
Conjuration (Creation) [Air, Cold, Earth, Electricity, Fire, or Water]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Up to five creatures or objects, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    From raw elemental matter, you form a magical dart of energy that streaks forward and strikes the target you designate. You choose to create an acid, cold, electricity, or fire dart when you cast the spell. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The dart deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +10). A creature struck by a dart can attempt a Fortitude save for half damage.
    You can't single out specific parts of a creature to attack. Unlike magic missile, you can damage inanimate objects with an elemental dart.
    At every odd caster level past 3rd, you gain an additional dart. You create two darts at 5th-level, three at 7th-level, four at 9th-level, and the maximum number of five darts at 11th-level or higher. You can attack with multiple darts in the same action in which you cast elemental darts at no penalty. If you fire multiple darts, you can have them strike a single target or several targets. A single dart can strike only one target. You must designate targets before you make attack rolls, check for spell resistance, or roll damage.
    Since the darts are composed of elemental energy, they may deal greater damage against targets susceptible to elemental damage-such as using fire dart against a white dragon, for example. Additionally, it is possible to be protected against elemental darts by appropriate spells, such as protection from elements, resist elements, and the like.

Effect: One summoned lesser elemental weird

    You conjure a lesser elemental weird to guard an area you designate. Choose one of the four types of elemental weirds and at least a 5-foot area comprised of the same element. The weird cannot move more than 100 feet from that spot and cannot leave the element that it is bound to. For example, a lesser water elemental weird tied to a point in a pond cannot leave the pond or go more than 100 feet from the point it is bound to, while a lesser air elemental weird would have free range within a space or open air but could not fly farther than 100 feet from the designated point. The lesser elemental weird you summon appears in the spot you designate and acts immediately on your turn. The lesser elemental weird attacks any creature other than you that comes within range of its attack. If you speak the same language as the weird you can provide it with more detailed instructions, like to not attack specific individuals or members of specific races, or to only attack certain creatures. The elemental weird obeys your commands until it is destroyed or the spell's duration expires, at which time it departs back to the appropriate Elemental Plane.
    A 15th-level caster can use permanency and expend 3,500 XP to make this spell permanent. This effect binds the lesser elemental weird to the area until destroyed.
    Material Component: A bowl or brazier filled with an element corresponding to the lesser elemental weird you plan to summon.

Saving Throw: No
Spell Resistance: No
    When you cast this spell, you create one or more flat, translucent green 5 foot-square, 1 inch-thick fields of force. You can create one emerald plane per two caster levels. An emerald plane cannot move, is immune to damage of all kinds, and is unaffected by most spells. However, disintegrate, Rod of Cancellation, or Sphere of Annihilation destroy any emerald planes they touch, while Mordenkainen's disjunction and dispel magic destroy all the emerald planes with a single casting. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the emerald planes in either direction, although teleportation effects are not stopped. It block ethereal and incorporeal creatures, as well as material creatures, from passing through. Hiding behind an emerald plane grants cover.
    An emerald plane cannot be conjured in a space already occupied by a creature or object. It must always be flat, either horizontal or vertical. When conjured, the emerald plane can only touch an object with one edge, though another object can come into contact after the spell is cast. No emerald plane can be within 5 feet of another emerald plane and must stretch the entire intersection of the 5 foot-square. They cannot overlap on 5 foot-squares.
    Emerald planes can be made permanent by using permanency.

    Energy Spheres [Magic of Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Acid, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Sonic]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: Five floating spheres
Duration: 1 round / level or until discharged
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text
    You toss each of the marbles into the air, making the incantation as you do so. Each marble turns a different color-pale green, white, blue, red, and violet-and settles into orbit around your head.
    You create a circle of five colored spheres that orbit your head at a distance of 1 foot. These spheres provide as much light as a torch and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic).
    If used to attack, on your turn as a standard action you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere deals 5 points of energy damage per five caster levels (maximum 20 points of damage) to a single creature, so an 11th-level caster's sphere deals 10 points of energy damage. The subject can make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere.
    If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage. Each sphere grants you energy resistance 5 per five caster levels. If a sphere is used to absorb damage, that sphere is destroyed.
    When used to attack a creature with spell resistance, make one spell resistance roll for all spheres that attack the target in a round. Success or failure applies to all spheres striking the creature that round.
    Material Component: Five glass marbles.

Spell Resistance: No
    The air wavers and shimmers, finally coalescing into a large cube of glistening ooze.
    Engulfing terror creates a gelatinous cube in a space you designate. The space must be large enough to accommodate the creature. If not, the spell automatically fails.
    Upon appearing, the cube acts on your turn, attacking the nearest living creature each round. You have no control over it and cannot direct it. The gelatinous cube remains until it is destroyed or has no remaining targets to attack, at which point it moves away in a random direction.

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An entomb spell traps living creatures in a block of ice, suffocating them. The spell entraps the targets with a thick layer of ice from head to toe. Those that make a successful Fortitude saving throw can shake off the ice immediately, though they still take 6d6 points of cold damage. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is held within the ice and immediately begins to suffocate per the drowning rules (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). In addition, the creature takes 2d12 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage per round from contact with the ice.
    Other than attempting to escape, creatures entombed can perform actions that only require mental or verbal activity.
    Escaping from the ice block requires a DC 20 Strength check or the application of 20 points of fire damage.
    Material Component: A clear gemstone with a minimum value of 500 gp.

Target: One ethereal creature
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You pinch a piece of glass between your fingers and as it crumbles to nothingness, a glassy prison springs into being.
    You create a translucent prison of pure crystalline force around a target on the Ethereal Plane. You must be able to see or otherwise target the creature you wish to affect.
    The subject affected by the chamber cannot move on either the Ethereal Plane or its coterminous planes for the duration of the spell but is otherwise unaffected. The subject cannot move onto another plane while inside the chamber, including the Material Plane.
    The subject within the crystalline prison cannot make physical attacks or be attacked and is unaffected by most spells and supernatural abilities. Gaze attacks and sonic spells function through the walls of the crystalline prison, but a creature within the chamber gains a +2 bonus on saving throws.
    The target of ethereal chamber can break the crystalline prison by making a Strength check (DC 10 + caster level). A disintegrate spell destroys an ethereal chamber.
    Material Component: A piece of translucent glass.

    Ethereal Mount [Manual of the Planes, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Bard 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Divine Bard 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Vigilante 4, Wizard 4
Effect: One quasi-real mount, plus one additional mount / 2 levels
    Your spell draws ether into form, creating a misty mount for you to ride.
    This spell functions like phantom steed (PH 260), except as noted here. You call into being one or more quasi-real mounts. These mounts accept only you and those that you designate as riders. The mounts appear as horses or any other commonly ridden mounts, but they have a foggy, almost translucent nature, and their colors shift across the spectrum over time.
    These mounts have AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex), and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. They do not fight and have no attacks. If reduced to 0 hit points, an ethereal mount melts into the ethereal fog from which it came.
    An ethereal mount has a speed of 240 feet on the Ethereal Plane and can carry its rider's weight plus 10 pounds per level. (If the Deep Ethereal is used in your cosmology, then the amount of time to reach destinations is halved while on an ethereal mount.)

    Evard's Black Tentacles [Player's Handbook]

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: 20ft-radius spread
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot - including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.
    Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.
    Once the tentacles grapple an opponent they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
    Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.
    Material Component: A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.

    You hold the metal tube out from your body and cast the spell. A bright ball of flame manifests and skips across the battlefield, immolating targets in its path.
    You create a path of flame when you cast this spell. Anything along this path takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures and objects it touches. The flame lights up the area as if it were a torch, and small sparks and decaying flames remain in the area for 1 round, shedding light as candles but dealing no damage. A creature or object can be affected only once by each casting of this spell.
    If the damage from the flame destroys an interposing barrier, the flame can move beyond the barrier if it has area remaining.
    Material Component: Bat guano, sulfur, and copper packed into a metal tube with one closed end.

    The type of drug extracted depends on the substance used.
        Material-   Drug-           Effect on Focus-
        Metal       Baccaran        Metal's hardness drops by 1.

    Falling Feathers [War of the Lance]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Pile of feathers whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level; see text
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates feathers that fall from the sky with surprising swiftness, creating a massive pile on the ground. Within moments, the feathers fill a 5-foot square (5-feet wide and 5-feet deep) per level of the spellcaster. The pile can be spread out or piled up, as you decide upon casting the spell, as long as the area the feathers fill up is contiguous (you cannot separate the feathers into distinct piles, the spell creates only a single pile).
    The feathers are harmless, and they do not noticeably impede movement; however, they can provide a handy way to create a safe landing place for falling creatures. Each 5-feet of depth will reduce the effective distance fallen by 10-feet when calculating falling damage (see Falling Damage in the Dungeon Master's Guide), with a 5-foot wide square providing enough support for a Small or Medium sized creature. For Large creatures, the pile must be at least 10-feet wide and 10-feet deep for the feathers to reduce damage, with an additional 5-feet (both in width and depth) pile needed per size category above Large. Tiny and smaller creatures have the effective distance fallen reduced by 20-feet per 5-feet depth of the feathers.
    Material Component: A piece of down.

    Fatal Flame [Complete Scoundrel]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Target: One living creature with 1 or more HD
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Will negates, Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A single spark of flame leaps from your finger into the target's body, waiting silently for its death.
    You place a tiny quantity of pure elemental fire within a creature, which interacts with the energy released by its death to create a small explosion. When the target creature is killed, its body explodes in a burst of flame, dealing fire damage to each adjacent creature equal to twice the target's HD or twice your caster level (maximum 20 points). Treat creatures with less than 1 HD as having 1/2 HD for the purpose of this spell's effect (so the spell deals 1 point of fire damage when triggered). A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Fatal flame has no ill effect on the target's body before its death.
    The target receives a Will save to negate the spell's effect.
    Material Component: A splinter of charred bone.

    Favorable Wind [Stormwrack]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 feet
Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: 10 minutes / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell produces a stream of wind that can fill a ship's sails, disperse vapors and gases, and keep flying creatures at bay. The wind force is strong, with a speed of about 30 mph. It begins where you stand and blows directly away from you; you can easily propel a sailing vessel by standing astern of the mast and directing the wind forward to fill the sails.
    Tiny or smaller creatures in the path of the wind are knocked prone, or if flying are blown back 1d6◊10 feet.
    Small creatures are checked and cannot make headway against the wind. Small airborne creatures are instead blown back 1d6◊5 feet.
    Medium and larger creatures can move normally within the effect.
    A favorable wind can't push a creature beyond the limit of its range.
    Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -2 penalty on ranged attacks and on Listen checks in the area of a favorable wind.
    The wind automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames.
    In addition to the above-noted effects, favorable wind can do anything that a strong natural wind could do. It can fan a large fire, disperse gases and vapors to the limit of its range in 1 round, and make sailing difficult for small craft nearby.

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell functions like stinking cloud, except as noted above and as follows.
    You exhale a 10-foot cone of stinking gas. Though the cone persists for only 1 round, creatures who succumb to its effects are still nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area of the cone. A creature that has a special saving throw bonus against poison may apply that to its saving throw against this spell. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by fetid breath.
    Legends maintain that this spell was created either by the yuan-ti or by an arcane worshipper of Khostren.
    Material Component: A clove of garlic or an onion, which you must eat.

    If you have the fire subtype, the range and area of the spell are doubled and the damage is 1d6 points of fire per round. If you are a magmin, your fiery aura deals double damage for the duration of the spell.

Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
    This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
    Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
    When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.
    Warm Shield: the flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    Chill Shield: the flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of phosphorous for the warm shield; a live firefly or glowworm or the tail portions of four dead ones for the chill shield.

Effect: Fiery spiders that cover a 10ft-radius spread
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Tiny lights appear in the darkness-one, ten, over a hundred. As they appear, the sound of insectile chittering increases, until a swarming army of flaming, otherworldly arachnids is gathered together at your command.
    You call forth a teeming mass of fire elementals the size of common spiders. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. Each round, you can use a move action to direct the spiders to move up to 30 feet. If the spiders are left undirected, they move at a speed of 15 feet toward the nearest living creature, if one isn't already in the affected area.
    As fire elementals, the fire spiders have immunity to fire and are thwarted by barriers that block neutral outsiders. Any cold spell of 3rd level or higher can disperse the fire spiders, ending the spell.
    Material Component: A pinch of sulfur.

Spell Resistance: Yes
    A fireball spell is a burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
    You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
    The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
    Material Component: A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

    Fireburst [Complete Arcane, Miniature's Handbook, Spell Compendium]

    Fires of Purity [Complete Divine, Oriental Adventures, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Druid 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Metal Master 6, Order of the Consuming Flame 6, Purification Domain 6, Sha'ir 6, Shaman (Kalamar) 6, Shugenja (Fire) 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Spirit Shaman 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wild Reaper 6, Wind Walker 6, Winter Warden 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless); see text
    You touch the target, and it bursts into flames that do not harm it, although the heat you feel from the fire seems quite real to you.
    The creature you touch bursts into magical flames that do not harm the subject, but are capable of harming anyone else who comes into contact with the creature.
    With a successful melee attack, the subject deals an extra 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +15). If the defender has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures that make successful melee attacks against the subject are susceptible to the same damage unless they attack with weapons that have reach, such as longspears.
    The subject of fires of purity takes only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.

    Firestride Exhalation [Dragon Magic]
Conjuration/Evocation (Teleportation) [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (Fire) 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 30 feet; see text
Area: Cone-shaped burst; see text
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    With a word and a gesture, you fill your lungs swirling, burning energy. Then, with a mighty exhalation, you flood the space before you with a powerful cone of fire. As the last wisps of energy leave your lips, your body becomes part of the breath weapon, allowing you to flow through space and reform your body anywhere within the breath's area.
    You breathe forth a cone of fire that deals 8d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies.
    When you cast this spell, you have the option of becoming part of the breath weapon and teleporting instantly to any unoccupied space within the breath weapon's area. Your entire body need not fit within the breath's area, as long as your new space shares at least 1 square with the breath weapon's area. You bring along any gear worn or carried (up to your maximum load). You can't bring along other creatures except for your familiar. You must make this decision when casting the spell, before any other effects of the breath weapon are resolved (such as saves, spell resistance, and so forth). You aren't damaged by the spell's effect when you appear within its area.

    You can ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, shuriken, and stones) into fiery projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.
    Material Component: A drop of oil and a small piece of flint.

    Flame Dagger [Magic of Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Gnome Artificer 2, Hathran 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: A dagger-like beam
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You evoke the spell and a blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand, ready to be used as a weapon.
    You create a bladelike beam that you can wield as if it were a dagger. Attacks with a flame dagger are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +10). Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame dagger can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on.
    This spell does not function underwater.
    Material Component: A candle.

    Flamewave [War of the Lance]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Metal Master 4, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wild Reaper 4, Wind Walker 4, Winter Warden 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: A 5 feet high moving wall of flame, up to 5ft-wide / 2 levels
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a sheet of devouring flames that move away from you at a steady speed, scorching anything in their path. The flamewave moves at a speed of 30 feet each round, in the same direction indicated at the casting of the spell, which cannot be changed. A flamewave moves over barriers less than 4-feet high, but it must travel across a solid surface. The flamewave is 5 ft. high and 1 ft. thick, and 5 ft. wide for every 2 levels of the caster. It ignites flammable substances.
    If the flamewave passes through a space occupied by a creature, the creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20). The flamewave deals double damage to undead creatures.
    Once the flamewave moves beyond the spell's range, it automatically winks out of existence. You may also dispel the flamewave at will.
    Arcane Material Component: A rectangular block of coal or incense.

    Flaming Sphere [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Blighter 2, Deathwalker 2, Dradench Academy Wizard Specialist 2, Druid 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Initiate of Garyx Feat 2, Metal Master 2, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Kalamar) 2, Shugenja (Fire) 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spirit Shaman 2, Wild Reaper 2, Wind Walker 2, Winter Warden 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft/ level)
Target: 5ft-diameter sphere
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
    The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
    Arcane Material Components: A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powered iron.

Range: Long (400ft + 40ft / level)
Area: 20ft-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw: Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A blinding flash of light follows the casting of this spell.
    Flashburst creates a blinding, dazzling flash of light. Sighted creatures within the area are blinded for 2d8 rounds. A successful Will save negates the blindness. Creatures in the area are dazzled for 1 round even if their save was successful. Creatures outside the area, but within 120 feet of the burst, can be blinded for 2d8 rounds if they have line of sight to the burst (Will negates). Creatures outside the burst area are not dazzled.
    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sulfur or phosphorus.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: 60 feet
Area: Cone-shaped burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell produces a brief windstorm (approximately 70 mph), filled with scouring, supernatural grit that literally strips flesh. In addition to the possible effects of the wind, creatures within the area of a flaywind burst spell take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) from the scouring sands. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
    A creature within the area of flaywind burst must make a Fortitude save or experience the effects of the wind's force. A Small or smaller creature is knocked down and rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Small or smaller creature is blown back 2d6xl0 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. Medium creatures are knocked prone, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet. Large or Huge creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the blast, or if flying are blown back 1d x5 feet. Gargantuan or larger creatures can move normally within a flaywind burst. Flaywind burst can't move a creature beyond its range.
    In addition to the effects noted, flaywind burst can do anything else that a windstorm-force sandstorm would be expected to do, such as briefly obscure vision, heel over a boat, or blow gases and vapors to the limit of its area.
    Material Component: A pinch of sand and the wing feather of a vulture.

    Floating Disk, Greater [Dragon #323 (pg 80), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: 3ft-diameter disk of force
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Letting the mercury drip to the ground you create a slightly concave disk of energy. It hovers several feet above the ground.
    This spell functions like Tenser's floating disk (PH 294), except that the created disk does not need to stay within 3 feet of the surface beneath it. However, the disk must remain within 15 feet of you at all times. You can concentrate (as a standard action) on the disk to make it move with a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect). This allows you to sit on the disk and command it to carry you about.
    Material Component: A drop of mercury.

    Force Chest [Dragon #323 (pg 80), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: Box of force 2 ft on a side
Duration: 24 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Holding your hands as if to grip a box, you feel the pressure of one appear as you complete the spell. The password you choose to unlock the box echoes through your mind.
    This spell brings into being a lidded box of force. The box appears in your hands, and you can choose to make it either invisible or merely translucent. The chest has no weight worth noting.
    Solid walls of force form the chest's five sides and lid. You and other creatures cannot open the lid except by first speaking the password (determined by you at the time of casting). Both objects and Tiny and smaller creatures can fit in the box; it holds enough air to supply one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures for 1 hour.
    Like a wall of force spell, a force chest is immune to damage of all kinds and resists dispel magic, but it is susceptible to disintegrate and Mordenkainen's disjunction, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. The box is a spell effect, and Open Lock and Use Magic Device cannot open it.
    Material Component: A 2-inch-square glass cube.

    Force Claw [Player's Guide to Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: Invisible claw of force
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Curling your hand into a claw, you finish the final gesture. Your foes see no result from your spell, but you know they're in for a surprise.
    Force claw creates a Medium claw of invisible force at any spot you designate within the spell's range. The claw guards the area of a 20-foot cube that you specify. You can move the claw's location up to 60 feet to another point within range each round on your turn as a move action.
    The claw is able to make attacks of opportunity against any enemy that provokes such attacks within the guarded area. It has a +10 bonus on the attack roll and deals 1d8+6 points of damage with a successful hit. It can make an unlimited number of attacks of opportunity each round, though it can make only one such attack per opportunity.
    Material Component: A small, dried claw from an animal.

    Force Hammer [Sharn (pg 168)]

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Force hammer is designed to bring down a single opponent without causing lasting harm. You fire a ray of force at a single target, making a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the bolt deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per level (maximum 10d4). If the target fails a Fortitude save, it is dazed for 1 round. (A successful saving throw does not reduce the damage.) Force hammer has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage cannot be dazed by the spell.

    Force Ladder [Magic of Faerûn, Spell Compendium]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One ladder of force up to 60 feet long
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You concentrate on the small silver model of the ladder in your outstretched hand. A transparent ladder, visible only by its edges, appears.
    You create an immobile transparent ladder made of force. The ladder is 2 feet wide and anywhere from 10 to 60 feet long, with rungs spaced 1 foot apart. The ladder functions as a normal ladder and can support any weight. It can be destroyed by anything that destroys a wall of force.
    Focus: A miniature silver ladder (50 gp).

    Force Missile Storm [Dragon #309 (pg 49)]
Evocation [Force, War]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Target: Up to 25 creatures / level within a 60ft-radius
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    As magic missile, except as noted. You can fire only one missile at each target regardless of your caster level.
    Material Component: 600 gp worth of diamond dust.

    Force Missiles [Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Target: Up to four creatures, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Sparking bolts of blue magic, like giant magic missiles, streak from your outstretched hand to strike your foes and explode in sparkling bursts.
    You create powerful missiles of magical force, each of which darts from your fingertips and unerringly strikes its target, dealing 2d6 points of damage. The missile then explodes in a burst of force that deals half this amount of damage to any creatures adjacent to the primary target.
    The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total cover or concealment. A caster cannot single out specific parts of a creature. The spell can target and damage unattended objects.
    You gain one missile for every four caster levels. You can make more than one missile strike a single target, if desired. However, you must designate targets before rolling for spell resistance or damage.

    Force Sphere [Player's Guide to the Sovereign Lands (pg 228)]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Area: 5ft-radius emanation centered on you
Duration: 1 hour / level (D)
    A flickering globe of pale, swirling yellow light surrounds you, pushing those you pass aside.
    Many spellcasters consider force sphere an impractical but impressive spell. It creates a light outward force that radiates from the caster's body. It presses against loose objects under 10 pounds, moving them outward. Unlocked doors open, objects are pushed away and people are jostled aside in a crowd. The spell's effect also provides a +2 deflection bonus to AC.
    Material Component: Two matching lodestones.

    Forcebarb [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Raulothim]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: 1 force object
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see text)
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a cylindrical glowing beam of force 10 feet long and 3 feet in diameter. One end of the forcebarb is a hook, while the other end is capped in a 5-foot-diameter sphere. It cannot be created to appear within a creature or solid object, though it is sufficient to occupy a 10 foot by 5 foot by 5 foot area (as if it were a creature with a space dimension equal to this amount). The forcebarb is immobile and sheds light as a candle.
    A creature that touches the forcebarb or passes through the area it occupies must save or be stunned for 1 round and take 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (a successful save avoids the stunning but still deals half damage; maximum 10d6).
    A shield spell that contacts a forcebarb is dispelled instantly if its caster level is less than yours, at no harm to the forcebarb. A forcebarb automatically destroys any dispel magic or minor globe of invulnerability effect whose area contacts it, destroying both the opposing spell and itself harmlessly in a spectacular burst of colored lights. Greater versions of these spells (such as greater dispelling or globe of invulnerability) negate a forcebarb instantly but are not destroyed by doing so.

    Forcewave [Magic of Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]

Range: 10 feet
Effect: 10ft-burst of force centered on you
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You catch the drop of water on the string and snap it at your target. The waterdrop swells and becomes a blue-green wave of magical force, tumbling toward your opponents.
    This spell initiates a bull rush against all creatures within 10 feet. The forcewave has a +10 bonus on the bull rush attempt. All creatures are pushed to the extent of the bull rush result, and the result of the bull rush can push creatures beyond the spell's normal range.
    Focus: A small piece of string and a drop of water.

    Fracture [Villain Design Handbook (pg 106)]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spellsinger 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Area: 1 cubic foot of material / level
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell causes an item to develop one or more very fine cracks. Fracture causes 1d4 points of damage plus 1 per caster level and discomfort for days if used on living matter. If used on nonliving matter, the caster may deal a similar amount of damage to the object. Regardless of whether or not the object takes any points of damage after accounting for hardness, its hardness will be reduced according to the table below for subsequent attacks.
        Material        Hardness Reduction
        Leather or similar  -1
        Wood or similar -2
        Ceramic or glass    -1
        Soft metal (jewelry)    -3
        Hard metal (weapons)    -4
        Bone        -4
        Stone (soft)    -5
        Stone (hard)    -6
    Material Component: A hammer

    Freezing Fog [Complete Arcane, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: Fog spreads in a 20ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Reflex partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    A cool mist rises from the area you indicate. The thick mist blocks your ability to see within it, but the ground at its edge has turned white with frost.
    A bank of freezing mist billows out from the point you designate, obscuring all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment, while creatures farther away have total concealment.
    Each round on your turn, the frigid mist deals 1d6 points of cold damage to each creature and object within it. The fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a maximum speed of 5 feet(regardless of its normal speed) and takes a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls and damage rolls and a -6 penalty on ranged weapon attack rolls (but not ranged spell attack rolls). A creature or object that falls into the fog from above is slowed, so that each 10 feet of mist it passes through effectively reduces overall falling damage by 1d6.
    Freezing fog also coats all solid surfaces in its area with a slick, icy rime, and on your turn each round, each creature in the area of the fog must make a successful Reflex save or fall prone. A creature that manages to stand must make a DC 10 Balance check in order to move, falling prone if it fails its save by 5 or more. Creatures in the fog can't take a 5-foot step.
    A severe wind disperses the cloud in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.

    Frost Armor [Warcraft (pg 162)]
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Warcraft) 0, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, F/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 hour / level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    A nearly invisible field of force surrounds the subject of frost armor. The temperature is noticeably chillier around the subject.
    Frost armor provides a +4 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, frost armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since frost armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
    Any creature striking the character with its body or with handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker becomes chilled. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to the chilling effect. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as two-handed spears, do not endanger their users in this way.
    A chilled creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate for 1 round. Chilled creatures can take only a move action or standard action on their next turn, but not both (nor may they take full-round actions). Additionally, they suffer a -2 penalty to AC, melee attack and damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Chilled creatures jump half as far as normal.
    Focus: A small piece of forged steel or a shaman's totem.

Area: Cone-shaped burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Giving a forceful exhale across your cupped hand, your breath shoots forth tinged with frost and crystals of ice.
    You breathe a cone of intense cold at your foes. The spell deals 1d4 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). In addition, all creatures damaged by the frost breath that fail their Reflex save are dazed for 1 round by the sudden shock of cold.

    Frost Nova (Diablo) [Diablo 2 (pg 40)]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Sorceress 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: See text
Effect: Ring; see text
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An icy version of nova, this spell creates a ring of freezing vapors that forms 10 feet away from you in all directions and blasts outward to a radius of 20 feet. Each creature within the affected area takes 1d4+1 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d4+5). A Reflex save reduces this damage to half, but those taking any frost nova damage must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed with cold and helpless for 1d3 rounds.

    Frost Nova (Warcraft) [Warcraft (pg 163)]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Shaman (Warcraft) 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Area: 10ft-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A frost nova spell is a burst of ice and cold that detonates with a high-pitched shriek.
    Frost nova deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area of effect; a successful Reflex save halves the damage. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creatures almost no pressure.
    A frozen, pea-sized bead streaks from the caster's finger and, unless it hits a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, shatters into the frost nova at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage such as an arrow slit, the caster must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
    Creatures that take damage from the frost nova must succeed at a Fortitude save or be chilled for 1d4 rounds. A chilled creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate for 1 round. Chilled creatures can take only a move action or standard action on their next turn, but not both (nor may they take full-round actions). Additionally, they suffer a -2 penalty to AC, melee attack and damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Chilled creatures jump half as far as normal.
    Material Component: A few drops of water and a piece of glass, which must be shattered as the spell is cast.

    Frozen Armor [Diablo 2 (pg 40)]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Sorceress 2, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: One or more creatures hitting you in melee
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You surround yourself with a field of icy cold, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to your AC, chilling foes that strike you. Whenever you are hit in melee combat, the creature that struck you must make a Fortitude save. Failure means the attacker also takes a -2 cold penalty to AC, melee attacks and damage, Reflex saves, and can jump only half as far as normal for 1 minute. The cold penalties are not cumulative-their duration is counted from the last failure.

    Frozen Moment [Legends of the Twins]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: One creature or object
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Will
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You cause the River of Time surrounding the target object's essence or the target creature's soul to stop flowing, but for only a few seconds. This immobilizes that creature or object in place. Everything around the target proceeds as normal, but the region of stopped time encasing the target makes it completely invulnerable to attacks, spells, and damage of any sort while the frozen moment is in effect. This spell does not affect anything larger than a Medium creature - it cannot be used to stop an elephant in its tracks, or to prevent a wagon from toppling over a cliff.
    Material Component: A drop of water.

    Furnace Within [Races of Eberron]
Evocation [Fire, Mindset]
Level: Anagakok 2, Ancestral Speaker 3, Arcane Disciple 3, Archivist 3, Aspirant 3, Beholder Mage 2, Benevolent 3, Cleric 3, Crusader (base) 3, Deathwalker 2, Evangelist 3, Favored Soul 3, Fleshcrafter 2, Knight of the Chase 3, Mystic 3, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Ur-Priest 3, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, DF, dwarf
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 feet
Area: 10ft-radius burst, centered on you
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The dwarves of the Mror holds embrace an ancient connection to the fiery heart of the Ironroot Mountains. Throughout their long history, dwarf spellcasters have sought to tap this kinship with their mountain homes and turn it into a more literal expression of the fiery dwarf heart.
    When you cast this spell, you release a great burst of energy that deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). The blast of flame sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. If an interposing barrier shatters or breaks due to damage from this spell, the blast of heat may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any spell does.
    Mindset: The energies you manipulate while preparing this spell cause an intense heat to well up within you. Although it doesn't harm you, this heat makes your unarmed strikes, natural weapon attacks, and melee attacks with metallic weapons deal 1 point of fire damage in addition to their normal damage. This heat dissipates when the spell is cast.

    Material Component: A loop of copper wire and a magnet.

Target: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a ray of water that blasts towards one target, that the caster designates. If the caster successfully hits with a ranged touch attack, the watery jet deals 2d6 points of subdual damage +1d6 per 2 caster levels (maximum +6d6). In addition, any creatures affected must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone. Geyser deals no damage to objects or to creatures that are immune to subdual damage.

    Ghost Lantern [Complete Mage]

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The object begins to glow with a phosphorescent white light. Your companions' faces are illuminated, but they cast no shadows on the surrounding walls.
    Ghost lantern causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright illumination in a 20-foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. Unlike normal light spells, this light is only visible to you and a number of specifically designated creatures equal to one per three caster levels (maximum five). These creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell but can later move as far apart as they want.
    No others can see the ghost lantern; it has no effect on them, and they are affected by other ambient light conditions as normal. Effectively, this spell allows you and your chosen companions to see in the dark.
    Material Component: A bit of phosphorescent fungus.

    Ghostly Tail [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Effect: Evoked tail
Duration: 1 hour / level
    A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you, as if it had always been there, and slaps at foes that leave themselves open to attack.
    You evoke a partially translucent, scaled tail that can attack foes that are vulnerable to attacks of opportunity. If your foe takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you, even if you are not holding a melee weapon that would normally threaten your foe, your evoked dragon's tail attacks the target with a melee touch attack, dealing 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. You can only strike with a ghostly tail if you have not already taken your allowed number of attacks of opportunity in the round.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, deals an extra 1 point of damage per level with a ghostly tail (maximum 20 points).

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Area: 20ft-radius
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You hurl a shard of ice to a target area within range within range. When the glacial spike reaches its target it explodes in a frigid blast of 20 feet radius, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to each creature within its area (max 15d6). A successful Reflex save reduces the damage to half. Those who fail also take a -2 cold penalty to AC, melee attacks and damage, Reflex saves, and can jump only half as far as normal for 1 minute.

    Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Hide checks.
    Material Component: Ground mica.

    Glowing Orb [Player's Guide to Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Light]
Level: Anagakok 3, Ancestral Speaker 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beholder Mage 3, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Crusader (base) 4, Deathwalker 3, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fleshcrafter 3, Knight of the Chase 4, Mystic 4, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Ur-Priest 4, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Effect: Magical, controllable light source
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Calling on the limitless light of the Positive Energy Plane, you coax a tiny portion of its power into a fragile glass sphere.
    This spell places a magical light source inside a glass sphere roughly the size of a human fist. You can control the light level generated by a glowing orb by mental command (a standard action), provided that the orb is within 30 feet of you. The light level ranges from no light at all to illumination within a 60-foot radius. There is no limit to the number of glowing orbs you can possess, and you can control their light levels independently or in concert.
    If a glowing orb is smashed, the magic is lost. If you die, however, an orb retains its magic. Any character with an Intelligence or Wisdom of at least 13 can gain control of an orb simply by touching it.
    Focus: A glass sphere (50 gp) into which the light is placed. An orb usable for this purpose has hardness 0 and 2 hit points.

    Gnome Blight [Races of the Dragon]

Area: Cloud spreads in 20ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You blow a mixture of pollen and ground mandrake root from your palm toward the targeted area. The granules are carried by a directed wind and explode into a cloud of yellow dust and seed.
    Gnome blight creates a thick cloud of agonizingly itchy pollen similar to that created by fog cloud, except that the pollen is sickening. Living creatures in the cloud become sickened. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each sickened individual.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.
    Creatures with sensitive olfactory senses (such as gnomes or creatures with the scent ability) take a -4 penalty on their saving throws.
    Material Component: Flower pollen and ground mandrake root.

    Golden Dragonmail [Champions of Valor]

Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Effect: One suit of magic armor
Duration: 1 hour / level (D); see text
    You create a suit of shining golden full plate around your body. The armor is etched with a dragonscale pattern, an image of a gold dragon, or Torm's holy symbol (your choice when you cast the spell). It is treated as +1 mithral full plate for all purposes (including arcane spell failure), and you are treated as proficient with this armor. Removing or destroying the armor dismisses the spell. This spell has no effect if you are already wearing armor.
    Torm the True is served by gold and silver dragons, and some of these dragons are the founders of ancient sorcerer bloodlines among the younger races. If you are a sorcerer, the armor also gives you resistance to fire 10.
    Focus: A gold coin and a piece of mithral in the shape of a dragonscale.

    Grasp of Cthulhu [Call of Cthulhu (pg 142)]
Evocation [Evil]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 3, Arcane Disciple 3, Archivist 3, Aspirant 3, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 3, Cleric 3, Crusader (base) 3, Deathwalker 4, Evangelist 3, Favored Soul 3, Fleshcrafter 4, Knight of the Chase 3, Mystic 3, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 3, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One Small, Medium, or Large creature
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Calling upon the name of Great Cthulhu, you summon forth magical energies that wrap around a subject, holding him motionless. Each round that the subject is grasped, he takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. The grasp of Cthulhu can do no more than render target unconscious. It cannot kill.

    Grasping Wall [Complete Scoundrel]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Hands sprout from a wall in an area of up to four 5ft-squares (S)
Duration: Concentration (maximum 1 round / level) + 3 rounds
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: No
    Hundreds of disembodied hands burst from the wall, forming a sea of clutching, probing appendages.
    You cause hands to sprout from a wall within range. This spell simply adds grasping hands to an existing wall rather than creating a wall of a substance.
    All opponents adjacent to the wall are entangled unless they succeed on Reflex saves. An opponent must repeat this save each round it remains adjacent to the wall.
    Allied creatures are not entangled, and in fact can use the hands to gain a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks to scale the wall. If the spell ends while you are climbing, you immediately fall but can make a normal Climb check to catch yourself (PH 169).
    Any objects on a wall affected by the spell are unharmed; doors, windows, and other apertures in the wall can be opened or closed as normal.
    Material Component: A handful of fingernails.

    Grease [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 1, Bard 1, Beholder Mage 1, Death Master 1, Deathwalker 1, Divine Bard 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Gnome Artificer 1, Jester 1, Magewright 1, Savant (Arcane) 1, Sha'ir 1, Slime Domain 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Vigilante 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
Target: One object or a 10ft-square
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).
    The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not).
    The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item - a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.
    Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter.

    You create a loud noise equivalent to a peal of thunder. The spell has three effects. First, all creatures in the area must make Will saves to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Second, the creatures must make Fortitude saves or be deafened for 1 minute. Third, they must make Reflex saves or fall prone. Creatures that cannot hear are not stunned, but might still fall prone.
    Focus: An iron bell.

    Guiding Light [Miniature's Handbook, Spell Compendium]

Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Across the murky plain, a beam of radiance shoots down, highlighting your foes.
    Bright lights shine at the targets. The lights grant a +2 circumstance bonus on ranged attack rolls against any highlighted target. If a creature gains total cover or total concealment relative to you, or if it leaves the area, the spell ends for that target.

    Guise of the Spirit Realms [Secrets of the Shadowlands]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 day / level or permanent; see text
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No
    One of the deepest secrets of the Tsuno Soultwisters, this spell allows the Tsuno to travel between the planes without suffering the ill effects of a Spirit realm's touch. The target becomes immune to any effects of a Spirit Realm's control, though he accumulates points of control normally. Affected creatures gain no special abilities or status effects due to these levels of control, but may be targeted and affected by effects that check for such levels of control. For example, although a creature under the effect of this spell would accumulate points of Shadowlands Taint, he would suffer no ill effects from the taint and could not draw upon the Taint for powers, but he would still be wounded by a jade strike. This spell normally lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. Casters of level 12 or higher may choose, at casting, to make effects permanent until either dispelled or changed by another casting of this spell.

Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
    Flames burn within your digestive tract, not harming you, but searing any creature or object that you have swallowed. In addition to any damage you normally deal to creatures you have swallowed, you also deal +1d6 points of fire damage per size category above Medium.
    As a standard action, you may spit out a burst of flaming goo much alchemist's fire in its composition, and identical in its effects. This ends the spell.
    Material Component: A hot chili pepper

    Gust of Wind [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Air]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Druid 2, Eagle Knight 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Gnome Artificer 3, Master of the South Wind 2, Metal Master 2, Nentyar Hunter 2, Purebreath Devotee 3, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Kalamar) 2, Shugenja (Air) 3, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spellsinger 2, Spirit Shaman 2, Storm Domain 2, Weather Domain 2, Wild Reaper 2, Wind Walker 2, Winter Warden 2, Wizard 2

Range: 60 feet
Target: Line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path.
    A tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 10 ft., taking 1d4 points of non-lethal damage per 10 ft. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of non-lethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
    Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6 x 10 ft.
    Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6 x 5 feet.
    Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.
    A gust of wind can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.
    Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a gust of wind.
    The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
    In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of range.

    Haboob [Sandstorm]
Conjuration (Creation) [Air, Earth]
Level: Anagakok 3, Ancestral Speaker 3, Arcane Disciple 3, Archivist 3, Aspirant 3, Beholder Mage 3, Benevolent 3, Cleric 3, Consecrated Harrier 3, Crusader (base) 3, Deathwalker 3, Druid 3, Evangelist 3, Favored Soul 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Knight of the Chase 3, Metal Master 3, Mystic 3, Ranger 3, Sand Domain 3, Scaled Horror 3, Sha'ir 3, Shaman (Kalamar) 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Spirit Shaman 3, Spirit Speaker 3, Ur-Priest 3, Wild Reaper 3, Wind Walker 3, Winter Warden 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Abrasive dust spreads in 20ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None or Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    A thick haze of swirling dust and sand swirls out from the point you designate. The effect obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment. Unprotected, non-magical flames are automatically extinguished, and there is a 50% chance that protected flames will be snuffed.
    In addition to obscuring sight, the swirling dust abrades any creature within it or attempting to move through it. Any creature passing through the haze takes 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), with no save allowed. If you conjure haboob so that it appears where creatures are located, each creature takes damage as if passing through the haze. Such creatures take half damage with a successful Reflex save, but if these creatures do not leave the affected area at their next opportunity, they take full damage from the abrading sands (no save) as if they had voluntarily entered the area. Any creature that remains within the affected area for more than 1 round likewise takes damage automatically (no save).
    A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the dust in 8 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 4 rounds. This spell does not function underwater.
    Material Component: A pinch of ash, dust, or sand.

    Hailstones [Savage Species, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Cold]

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: One frigid globe / 5 levels
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The crystal globes in your hand vibrate intensely before turning ice-cold. As you hurl them, they resemble balls of ice, an observation borne true when they strike and shatter into a shower of ice crystals.
    You create frigid hailstones that strike your enemies. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit with a globe. Each hailstone deals 5d6 points of cold damage.

    Halaster's Shaking Hand [City of Splendor: Waterdeep]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
    As Bigby's interposing hand, except that the hand can grapple the magic hand created by the following spells: Bigby's clenched fist, Bigby's crushing hand, Bigby's forceful hand, and Bigby's grasping hand. The shaking hand gets one grapple attack per round. Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards or sorcerers, respectfully), +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), and +4 for being Large.
    Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the shaking hand by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the shaking hand. In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic hand has a Strength score of 17 + twice the level of the spell. Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your shaking hand from attempting another grapple check.
    For example, a wizard using Halaster's shaking hand to grapple a sorcerer's Bigby's forceful hand, rolls an 10 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large), for a total of 27. The sorcerer rolls an 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Charisma score (18), adds +8 for the hand's Strength score (27), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large), for a total of 30. the "handshake" (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round. If however, the sorcerer had rolled a 15 or higher, the handshake would have been broken, at least until the shaking hand successfully grappled the forceful hand again.

    Hidden Lodge [Complete Arcane, Spell Compendium]

Level: Anagakok 5, Bard 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Divine Bard 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, F; see text
Duration: 24 hours
    You picture in your mind the desired appearance of a camouflaged lodge even as you complete the motions and words of the spell. When you finish, you open your eyes and note a new feature in the landscape roughly the size of a house.
    This spell functions like Leomund's secure shelter (PH 247), except as noted here. The house created by hidden lodge is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It might appear as a house-sized boulder in a rocky or mountainous area, as a sand dune in the desert, as a densely tangled thicket, a grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The lodge also obscures all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within.
    At any distance of more than 30 feet, the lodge is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 30 feet is entitled to a DC 30 Survival check to spot the hidden lodge as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape.
    Focus: The focus of an alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell), if this benefit is to be included in the hidden lodge (see Leomund's secure shelter for more information).

    Howling Chain [Player's Guide to Faerûn, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: One chain of force
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A blood-red chain of pure force appears, howling instead of rattling as it shakes and twines.
    You create a chain of force, which lashes out and attacks your enemies. The chain has a reach of 15 feet, but cannot move from the space you designate. The chain attacks by attempting to trip your foes (+12 melee touch attack, +15 on the opposed Strength check). It does not provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping, nor can it be tripped in response on a failed attempt. If it succeeds in tripping an enemy, it immediately follows up with a melee attack on the prone defender (+12 melee attack, 2d6+10 points of damage). Any creature struck by the chain must make a Will saving throw or become shaken.
    A howling chain can make one attack of opportunity each round for every four caster levels you have, using the same tactic as above.
    A howling chain has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't deal damage do not affect it. It makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it.
    Focus: A small length of platinum chain worth at least 500 gp.

The ice dagger deals 1d4 points of cold damage to the target per caster level (maximum 5d4), and splash damage of 1 point of cold damage to adjacent creatures.

Range: Long (400ft + 40ft / level)
Effect: One icy missile
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial or Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You shake your hand as if to free it from some substance you disdain. As you do, a magical shard of ice blasts from your hand and speeds to its target, the sound of cracking ice following in its wake.
    You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to hit (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll for every two caster levels). If it hits, an ice knife deals 2d8 points of cold damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage (a successful Fortitude save negates the Dexterity damage). Creatures that have immunity to cold also take no Dexterity damage automatically.
    A knife that misses creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10-foot-radius burst (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon, PH 158, to determine where the shard hits). The icy burst deals 1d8 points of cold damage to all creatures within the area (Reflex half).
    Material Component: A drop of water or piece of ice.

    Ice Rift [Frostburn]

Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Area: 40ft-radius spread (S)
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    When you cast ice rift, an intense but highly localized tremor rips through the ice. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ice, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ice can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ice must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The ice rift affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an ice rift spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
    Ice or Snow Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and burying that creature in snow. An ice rift cast on the roof of a very large ice or snow cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
    Edge of a Glacier: Ice rift causes a glacier's edge to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An ice rift cast at the top of a 100-foot glacier would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the glacier. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath rubble (see above).
    Open Glacier: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
    Frozen Water: Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into the freezing water (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). Characters who fall into a fissure are immediately subject to hypothermia and take 2d6 points of cold damage from the frigid water. At the end of the spell, all rents in the ice grind shut, sealing any creatures in the icy water beneath (for additional rules on characters in cold water, see Hypothermia, Frostburn page 10).
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of earth and a pinch of snow.

    Ice Storm [Player's Handbook]

Target: Cylinder (20ft-radius, 40ft-high)
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Great magical hailstones pound down for a full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. A -4 penalty applies to each Listen check made within the ice storm's effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).
    Arcane Material Components: A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.

    Ice Web [Frostburn]
Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, Coldfire
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Webs of coldfire in a 20ft-radius spread
Duration: 10 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    Ice web creates a many-layered mass of strong, frigid strands of pure coldfire. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points-floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like - or else the ice web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within the ice web become entangled in the strands. Attacking a creature in an ice web won't cause you to become entangled.
    Any creature moving into or through the spell's area takes 1d6 points of frostburn damage per round.
    In addition, anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the ice web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
    If you have at least 5 feet of ice web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of ice web between you, it provides total cover.
    The strands of an ice web are immune to damage from cold. Any fire-a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth-can melt 5 square feet of coldfire strands in 1 round.
    Ice web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent ice web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.
    Creatures with the cold subtype may pass unimpeded and unharmed through an ice web.
    Coldfire Component: Two ounces of coldfire.

Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage. In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the result of the attack, the icelance shatters upon its first use.
    Focus: A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone. Alternatively, if you are in a cold region, you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or snow for the quartz.

    Icy Sphere [Dragon #317 (pg 70)]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5

Effect: 3ft-diameter sphere of ice that moves in a straight line from you to the limit of the spell's range
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a ball of magic ice and frozen energy. The sphere darts away from you in any direction indicated, in a straight line, to the limit of the spell's range. Any creature in a square crossed by this line must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the sphere; success indicates that the creature takes no damage, but failure indicates the creature takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and becomes paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.

    Immolation [The Key of Destiny]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You cause a creature to burn from within. When the spell is first cast upon a creature, it is allowed a Fortitude save to shake off the spell completely. If the victim fails his initial saving throw, he takes an immediate 1d6 points fire damage. In each subsequent round following the first, the victim must make an additional Fortitude save or suffer another 1d6 points of fire damage. The internal flames continue to burn for as long as you maintain concentration, or until the spell has dealt a maximum of 15d6 points of damage
    If the creature dies as a result of this spell (is brought to -10 hp or lower), then the victim's body is instantly consumed by flame, leaving behind of ash (and thus making it very difficult to use spell such as raise dead, although there is enough "remains" for a reincarnation or resurrection spell), although the victim's possessions remain mostly untouched as the body incinerates almost instantaneously.
    Material Component: A ball of wax filled with ash from a funeral pyre.

    Immolation (Warcraft) [Warcraft (pg 164)]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text
    The caster is wreathed in blue and green flames.
    This spell causes a great deal of heat, inflicting 1d6 points of fire damage each round to all creatures within 5 feet. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. The flames give off light equal to a sunrod (30 feet).
    The flames also protect the caster from cold-based attacks. The character takes only half damage from cold-based attacks. If a cold-based attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, the caster takes no damage on a successful save.
    Material Component: A bit of phophorus.

    Incarnum Arc [Magic of Incarnum]
Evocation [Incarnum]

Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Area: Line from you to a point you designate within range
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    When you cast this spell, you create a drifting "lightning rod" of incarnum that appears at the point you designate within range. Instantly, an arc of soul energy forms between you and the incarnum rod, creating a line. At the end of your turn, any living creature in that line takes 1d6 points of damage (Reflex negates).
    In subsequent rounds, incarnum arcs again between you and the rod at the end of your turn. You can move the rod up to 20 feet by an act of will as a move action, or you can leave it in place and move yourself if you wish to change the path of the arc. If the distance between you and the rod at the end of your turn is beyond the spell's range, no arc occurs but the spell remains active.
    Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this spell increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points (2d6 points for 1 point of essentia, 3d6 points for 2 points of essentia, and so on).
    Material Component: A small brass rod.

    A slick, greasy liquid seeps from the targeted object, thoroughly coating it.
    This spell functions like grease (PH 237), but the liquid is also highly flammable. If any fire damage is dealt within the area of the spell (or to the subject of the spell), the spell's area (or subject) bursts into flame. This effect deals 4d6 points of damage to anyone in the area (or holding the subject), but also ends the spell's duration. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area: 5-ft.-radius spread
    As fireball, except as noted above, the spell's appearance, and its method of targeting. Instead of a glowing bead, the spell appears as a large flaming bull's head that utters a deep lowing as it approaches its target.
    The spell may be targeted normally, or it can be launched to find creatures you cannot see, using their heat to locate them. If launched in this way, the spell travels in a straight line from you in the direction you indicate, using its range as its entire speed for the round (it flies as a creature with Average maneuverability) and able to detect heat sources anywhere within its range. It does not turn back toward you. It detonates if it reaches a heat source, impacts a solid barrier, or travels the full extent of its speed.
    Most constructs, oozes, plants, undead, vermin, incorporeal creatures, and creatures with the [Cold] designator cannot be detected by the spell. Creatures with the [Fire] designator can always be detected by the spell.

    Leomund's Billet [Heroes of Battle]

Effect: 20ft-by-80ft structure
Duration: 2 hours / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates a simple building similar to a Leomund's secure shelter that can be used to house up to forty troops. The billet has a latched door at each end and two shuttered windows on each long side. These doors and windows can be barred from the insight, but the billet does not provide any magical protection.
    The billet contains forty bunks (stacked two high), two trestle tables with ten stools each, and two fireplaces with raging fires already burning and enough wood to last for one night. Twenty loaves of bread are stacked on each table, and a pot of hot gruel hangs on a hook over each fire.
    Material Component: A rectangular chip of stone, crushed lime, iron fillings, several splinters of wood, a pinch of flour, a sprinkling of water, and a sliver of dried beef.

    Leomund's Secret Chest [Player's Handbook]

Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: See text
Target: One chest and up to 1 cubic foot of goods / caster level
Duration: 60 days or until discharged
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
    The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time - even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are non-magical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
    To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
    Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.
    Focus: the chest and its replica.

    Leomund's Secure Shelter [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Bard 4, Beholder Mage 4, Cavern Domain 4, Deathwalker 4, Divine Bard 4, Feast Domain 5, Fleshcrafter 4, Merchant Prince 3, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Urban Druid 4, Vigilante 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M, F; see text
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
Target: 20ft-square structure
Duration: 2 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast - stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
    The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise - it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants).
    The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
    The secure shelter contains rude furnishings - eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
    Material Components: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, and a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) and the focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if these benefits are to be included.

    Leomund's Tiny Hut [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Bard 3, Beholder Mage 3, Builder Domain 4, Deathwalker 3, Divine Bard 3, Eagle Knight 3, Far Horizons Feat 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Herald Feat 3, Jaguar Knight 3, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 3, Merchant Prince 2, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Urban Druid 3, Vigilante 3, Witch 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 20 feet
Target: 20ft-radius sphere centered on your location
Duration: 2 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half of the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium-size creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
    The temperature inside the hut is 70 degrees Fahrenheit if the exterior temperature is between 0 and 100 degrees. An exterior temperature below 0 or above 100 lowers or raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus if it's -20 degrees outside, inside it's 50 degrees). The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
    The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it simply on command, or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).
    Material Component: A small crystal bead that shatters when the spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled.

    Leomund's Tiny Igloo [Frostburn]
Evocation [Cold]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 5 feet
Effect: 5ft-radius sphere, with l inch-thick wall / level centered on your location
Duration: 2 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a small domed snow house with a single entrance passage. Up to one Large or three Medium or twelve Small creatures can fit into the igloo with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
    The temperature inside the igloo is magically warm, at exactly 50∞ F, and the walls do not melt. The igloo has two features that help arctic survival: a sleeping platform and a lamp. The snow sleeping platform takes advantage of the warm air trapped below the low roof, generated by body heat and a stone lamp. The magical smokeless lamp provides heat for comfort and for cooking.
    The igloo also provides protection against the elements, such as wind, snow, and hail. The igloo withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
    The loose-packed snow of the igloo has a hardness of 0, and 3 hp per inch of thickness.
    Material Component: A small dollop of seal fat or caribou fat.

Target: One creature / level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart; or one lich
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half (object)
Spell Resistance: No
    If the target of this spell is the lich itself, it is struck by an intense bolt of pure white light that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). However, half the damage that the lich would suffer is instead transferred to all of the any undead created by the lich through spells or supernatural abilities, and any that have fallen under its sway due to the undead control or undead mastery abilities. It does not include any self-willed undead that obey the lich out of fear or loyalty rather than magical control. The channeled damage is spread evenly among the lich's minions.
    If the target of the daggers are undead creatures controlled by the lich, a number of tiny bolts of energy shoot forth from the caster's hands. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of damage and can be targeted at a single minion or several minions. Each targeted minion can attempt a Fortitude save (regardless of the number of bolts that strike it) to take half damage. Half of the total damage the targeted minion would be dealt by this spell is instead transferred to the lich that controls them.
    If a creature or object struck by lichbane daggers is not controlled by a lich, it suffers only 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4).

    Arcane Material Component: A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

    The silvery radiance created by this spell emanates from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light extends for an additional 30 feet.
    Beginning one turn after you cast this spell, you can choose to expend some or all of the light of Lunia as a ray of light. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet. Spell resistance applies to this attack. This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet). You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round. Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell.

Duration: 1 minute / level or until expended; see text
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: No
    The earth around your feet begins to ripple, and a directed shock wave of tectonic force is released that shoots through the ground.
    Immediately upon completion of the casting of this spell and as often as once per round thereafter, you can cause the ground to shake along a 30-foot line. You can produce a number of these tremors equal to your caster level (maximum five).
    The tremors begin at your location and extend in the direction you indicate; any creature caught standing within the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. A spellcaster caught standing on one of these squares must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell that was being attempted.
    You need not produce a tremor immediately upon finishing the casting of this spell. You can perform other actions, even the casting of other spells, between producing new tremors. Calling up a new tremor in any round after the spell has been cast requires a standard action (as you refocus your concentration on the spell).

    Lord of the Sky [Dragon Magic]
Evocation/Transmutation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Initiate of Bahamut Feat 5, Sha'ir 5, Shugenja (All) 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Suel Arcanamach 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level or until expended
    A swirling cloud of black mist surrounds you, shot through with bolts of lightning and covering you in powerful magic.
    By casting this spell, you become more formidable in aerial combat, allowing you to deal with airborne enemies more easily. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability (or 30 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or carry a medium or heavy load). If you already have a fly speed of 40 feet or greater, your fly speed improves by 10 feet, and your maneuverability improves to good (unless it's already better than that).
    While airborne, you can use a swift action each round to fire a bolt of magical lightning as a ranged touch against any other airborne target within 60 feet. This attack deals 1 point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20) and reduces the target's fly speed to one-half normal for the duration of the spell. This speed reduction doesn't stack, so attacking the same target multiple times yield no extra reduction in fly speed (but continues to deal damage).
    Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate one lightning bolt (as the spell) as a standard action. Doing so ends the duration of lord of the sky, and if you do not have a natural fly speed, you drift to the ground as per the fly spell..
    Special: If you are of the Dragonblood subtype, this spell grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if encumbered as described above). Dragonblooded casters who already have a fly speed of 60 feet or greater instead gain a +10-foot improvement to their fly speed.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area: 30-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    You call upon the powerful magnetic forces of the vast lodes of metal hidden deep within the mountains to focus on a specific point in range. All unattended ferrous metallic objects that weigh less than 10 pounds per caster level are immediately hurled in a random direction to a point just beyond the area of the spell's burst. All creatures in the area take 5d6 points of damage. Alternatively, you can direct the spell inward, and all unattended ferrous metallic objects are hurled toward the center of the area; this inflicts 3d6 points of damage to all of the objects and to all creatures in the area . A successful Reflex saving throw negates the damage done by either type of magnetic pulse.
    Attended ferrous metal objects are affected differently by this spell. Fairly small ferrous metal objects worn on the body (such as jewelry) are whisked off the creature's body unless he makes a Reflex save. Most jewelry pieces (especially magic items), however, are not made of ferrous metal. Characters in ferrous metal armor (which is most metal armor) are subjected to a trip attack made by a Large creature with an effective Strength of 22 (the bonus on the trip attack is +4 for size and +6 for Strength for a total bonus of +10). Similarly, the spell makes a disarm attack (using your base attack bonus + 6 for the spell's effective Strength) against any ferrous weapons or objects held in an affected creature's hands. Creatures made primarily of ferrous metal (such as iron golems) are subjected to a bull rush attack from a Large creature. The effective Strength is 22 (+4 size and +6 Strength for +10 bonus on the check) in the direction of the pulse.
    If this spell is cast in mountainous terrain, the area is doubled to a 60-foot-radius burst, and the pulse's effective Strength score increases to 30 (+10 Strength bonus).
    Material Component: A lodestone.

Furthermore, since the armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

If you can communicate with the wyvern, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

From the subject's perspective, the caster appears to be staring out of the mirror, replacing the subject's own reflection or appearing right behind him (caster's choice). The caster can have per image say up to one word per caster level before it disappears, if she chooses. The image remains for only 1 round. Subjects not expecting a mirror sending can be greatly unnerved by this spell.
    Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000gp. The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet.

    Mistclaw [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Thalagyrt]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: Small draconic claw made of mist
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a disembodied dragon claw made out of shadowy translucent mist. It moves within range as you direct it (a free action). The claw can pass through any opening that would allow fog or mist to pass through it. It can be used in one of two ways, and you can change the way that you use the claw each round.
    Directed Attack: As a standard action you can direct the claw to attack a creature in range.
    Supplemental Attack: As a free action you can direct the claw to assist you in fighting a creature you are attacking in melee. The claw does not interfere with your attacks, nor you its (for example, neither you nor the claw suffer any penalties for fighting with two weapons).
    The claw always uses your melee attack bonus and deals 1d4+4 points of slashing damage. It is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. It does not get iterative attacks. It always attacks from your direction and cannot flank or gain the benefits from flanking with another creature. The claw does not convey spells (unlike spectral hand). If not directed to attack on a particular round, the claw returns to you and hovers. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check against that spell resistance the first time the mistclaw strikes it. If the creature resists the spell, the claw is dispelled, otherwise it has its normal full effect on the creature.
    The claw can be attacked. It is treated as a Small creature (+1 size bonus to AC) with a natural armor bonus equal to your Intelligence (if a wizard spell) or Charisma (if a sorcerer spell) bonus. It has 10 hit points +1/caster level. Destroying the mistclaw does not harm you. It is not incorporeal and does not have an incorporeal miss chance, and it does not ignore the miss chance of incorporeal targets (though it can harm incorporeal creatures because it is treated as a magic weapon).
    The wizards Cardatha of Silverymoon and Baerdrunsun of Alaghon are known to have independently demonstrated versions of the mistclaw spell at recent magefairs.
    Focus: Mist, fog, or steam, whether present naturally in the environment, created by magic, or trapped in a closed container possessed by the caster. Non-draconic casters must also have a dragon scale or talon as a focus.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The phantom watchdog immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those already within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) the hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
    If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purposes of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
    The effect lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.
    Material Component: A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread.

Effect: Phantom bloodhound
    You conjure a phantom hound, that can track and bring down your prey.

    A trusted bloodhound can't attack, provide a flank, or have any other effect on combat. However, as a standard action, you can instruct a trusted bloodhound to serve as a watchdog; in this role it functions identically to Mordenkainen's faithful hound, except that its attack bonus equals your caster level. You can command a trusted bloodhound to resume its tracking again as a standard action.

Effect: 40ft-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a landslide of mud and water, which crushes, buries, and mires those caught in its path. The mud covers the area of the spell to a depth of about 10 feet (although it might fill low-lying areas or fail to cover high points in the area, at the DM's discretion).
    Creatures within the spell's effect must make a Reflex save. Those who fail take 8d6 points of damage and are buried (see Avalanches on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Those who succeed take 3d6 points of damage and are not buried. Creatures of the fire subtype who are actually aflame (such as salamanders, azers, and fire elementals) instead take 8d8 or 3d8 points of damage, respectively. A creature who escapes burial ends up on top of the mudslide, mired in deep mud.
    After the initial slide, the mudslide persists indefinitely, producing an area of deep bog (average depth 10 feet) until the water in it evaporates. It requires 4 squares of movement to enter 1 square of deep bog, and running or charging are impossible in the area. Underwater, the mudslide remains indefinitely, producing an area of deep muck. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square containing deep muck, the DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 5, and the DC of Move Silently checks increases by 2. Aboveground, the mud normally dries out in 2 to 3 days. A transmute mud to rock spell hardens the slide into stone, trapping any creatures still within.

Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Effect: A trail 20 feet long / level
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: No
    The caster creates a handful of invisible, nigh intangible powder that attracts creatures from the Lower Planes. The caster can sprinkle this powder in a trail on the ground. Evil outsiders who come within 10 feet of any portion of this trail and fail their saving throw follow the trail as if affected by a compulsion effect.
    Compelled fiends will follow a nether trail even into danger. For example, the trail could lead to a trap, a holy spell effect, or even a prison spell. If the danger is obvious, such as a blade barrier, the compelled creatures get another saving throw to resist.
    A compelled creature only follows the trail to its end. So, if the trail leads to the edge of a cliff, the fiend goes to the edge of the cliff and no farther.
    If a creature encounters the trail in the middle, it instinctively senses which direction is forward and which is backward. When the evil outsider reaches the end of the trail, the compulsion effect ends, and the creature cannot be affected by this particular nether trail again.
    The trail can be obscured and destroyed by anyone who can see invisible objects. It takes a standard action to destroy 10 feet of trail, but an evil outsider must make its saving throw first.
    Material Component: A urine-soaked holy symbol, which crumbles into the powder that creates the nether trail.

The night watchman cannot physically interact with the caster or others in any way. It communicates the presence of danger to the caster telepathically.

Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A sphere of intense cold energy rolls in whichever direction you point and damages those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d6 points of cold damage as well as 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates both the cold damage and Dexterity damage. A numbing sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls. It instantly freezes water it encounters in 5-foot-cube sections, creating chunks of ice in large bodies of water.
    The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely remains at rest. The sphere can be destroyed by attacks directed against it. It has 10 hit points and damage reduction 5/-.
    The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by extreme cold. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A numbing sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of sponge and a drop of water.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Target: See text
Duration: Instantaneous or 1 round/level; see text
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Otiluke's freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 10 foot radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).
    If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength Check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.
    You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge (see PHB page 176). You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere burst centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.
    Arcane Focus: A small crystal sphere.

These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
    Material Components: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.

Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level (D) or until expended
    Your entire body sparkles as color fades from your form. A stiff breezes picks up as you collapse into thousands of particles of sand, sent flying on the warm wind.
    You and your belongings become a flying cloud of sand, swirling and formless yet retaining your consciousness. You lose your normal shape and become a sand cloud, taking up the same space you do in your normal form. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet (perfect maneuverability), but you lose any other movement rates you had in your normal form. Treat this otherwise as gaseous form.
    If you end your movement in the same space as another creature, that creature is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Spell resistance does not apply against this effect.
    Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a gust of wind effect (as the spell) as a swift action. Doing so ends the duration of passage of the shifting sands.
    Special: A blue dragon capable of casting 6th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.

    Pebble Wind [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Olothontor]
Evocation [Air]

Effect: 20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No (see text)
    As gust of wind, except as noted above and as follows.
    Instead of a path of wind, you create a whirling mass of air. The whirlwind carries sand, dirt, and other small objects (nothing heavier than a chicken egg) into the air, creating an opaque cloud of debris. Creatures must succeed at Fortitude saves as described in gust of wind to avoid being checked or moved by the spell. Creatures blown over or moved by the wind are pushed in a random direction.
    The flying debris causes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 10d4); this damage is subject to damage reduction and creatures are allowed a Reflex save for half damage. If the debris is primarily composed of soft or very small objects, the spell deals 1d4 hit points per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d4). The spell deals damage to objects within the spread, though hardness will usually negate this damage, and can scour paint from walls and signs if small hard particles (such as sand) comprise the debris.

Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None

    You hold a dagger in your hand and concentrate on it, evoking the power of the spell. A duplicate of the dagger, made of translucent force, appears besides it and flies off at your command.
    You bring into being a tiny blade of force. The blade flies at a speed of 40 feet (perfect) and attacks any target within its range, as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. The blade attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + 1/2 your Cha modifier or Int modifier (for sorcerers and wizards, respectively) and deals 1d4 points of damage, with a critical threat range of 19-20. If an ally also attacks the creature, the blade moves on your turn to flank the target. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The blade cannot be attacked.
    Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the blade to a new target; otherwise, it continues to attack the same target. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the persistent blade strikes. If the blade is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the blade has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
    Focus: A silvered dagger.

Effect: One invisible, mindless, shapeless thief
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    As you invoke this spell, the spool begins to spin, the thread vanishing as it unravels. There is a wrinkly of force that flashes briefly; then it evaporates, leaving only the promise of power behind.
    An invisible force, not unlike the product of an unseen servant spell, comes into being where you wish. On your turn, this force steals objects from others as you inaudibly direct it (a free action). A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature or can pick up an unattended object, as long as the object weighs no more than 1 pound per caster level. It cannot break into locked chests. A phantasmal thief has a Hide modifier (useful against those who can see invisible creatures) and a Move Silently modifier both equal to your caster level.
    If a phantasmal thief goes undetected, it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not holding or wearing. Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can steal objects, bring objects to you, or put them back where they came from. It can take no other actions. A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to you.
    A phantasmal thief can hold only one object at a time, and the object becomes invisible in its grasp.
    A thief cannot take an item if it is detected by the creature it's trying to steal from (with a Listen or Spot check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled.
    A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature's hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so with a bonus on the disarm check equal to your caster level. If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears after it brings the stolen object to you.
    Material Component: A spool of green thread.

Duration: 1 hour / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
    The mount has an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its riders weight plus up to 10 lbs per caster level.
    These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. Thus the mount created by a 12th level caster, has the 8th, 10th and 12th caster level abilities.
    8th Level: the mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
    10th Level: the mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability)
    12th Level: the mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.
    14th Level: the mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).

    With a mighty roar, the caster brings into being a wall of sonic energy that emits a deafening rumble. Within 20 ft to 50 ft of the wall, all Listen checks suffer a -4 circumstance penalty due to the noise. Likewise, someone even farther suffers the same penalty on Listen checks to hear a noise within that area. While within 10 ft to 20 ft of the wall, all creatures must succeed a Fortitude save each round or be deafened permanently, even those that succeed the save are deafened while within 20 ft of the wall.
    While within 10 ft of the wall, all the above effects take place, plus failure of the Fortitude save each round causes the creatures to take 2d6 points of sonic damage for that round. Deafened creatures must still make a save or take the damage.
    The wall itself has no hardness, but is quite solid. It has 10 hit points per caster level and is immune to cold, fire, and sonic damage. Disintegrate destroys it automatically. Silence cast in an overlapping area around the wall, protects those in the affected area. Also, silence cast in an overlapping area in the wall, creates a gap in the wall. This does not damage the wall, only suppresses it.

Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 feet
Effect: Cone-shaped Burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half and Fortitude negates: see text
Spell Resistance: No
    A swirling blast of the desert's elements assaults the caster's opponents. Creatures in the affected area cough and gag as the sand pours into their mouths and noses, scratching their eyes, and scours their flesh, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
    In addition, affected creatures must make a Fortitude save or suffer a -2 penalty on all attacks, checks, and saves for one minute, due to the painful, searing sand. Creatures that are immune to critical hits, ignore this penalty and take only half damage from the spell (none on a successful Reflex save).

    A violent burst of sand and howling wind streams forth from your hand, extending outward in a cone.

    Any creature that succeeds on a Fortitude save takes half damage from the sandblast and ignores the wind effect.
    Material Component: A handful of sand from the heart of a desert.

    Sandstorm (Kalamar) [Player's Guide to the Sovereign Lands (pg 237)]
Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Sandstorm 60ft-wide and 30ft-high
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    By flinging a handful of sand and whispering some arcane words, you cause a great wind to arise, blowing sand with amazing ferocity.
    Sandstorm blocks all sight within its area (including darkvision). Movement through the area is reduced to half normal due to the winds and blowing sand. The sand extinguishes all fires it encompasses as well.
    Material Component: A handful of sand.

    Scalespurs [Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Galadaeros]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal
Effect: Up to 32 handles of force on your body
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
    You create a number of semicircular handles of force equal to your height or length in feet. These handles have a radius of 1 foot and emerge from any part of your body you desire. They are attached to you as firmly as your own limbs and cause you no discomfort (although excess weight or force applied to one of the handles can injure you if it that weight or force would harm one of your normal limbs).
    Galadaeros developed this spell to help Galadrans riding him to stay on even in the middle of combat. Normally riders tether themselves to the handles with harnesses and also hold on with their hands. A person merely holding onto the bars is treated as if on a military saddle (+2 bonus on all Ride checks related to staying mounted). A person strapped in cannot fall off the mount unless the straps are untied or cut (a move-equivalent action).
    The handles cannot be used to make attacks, even against ethereal or incorporeal creatures, nor do they provide you any defense. A person lying flat between two handles has up to one-half cover.
    Grapple checks made against you while the handles are present get a +5 circumstance bonus.
    The handles are not subject to dispel magic but are destroyed by disintegrate.
    The spell gets its name from an earlier version that actually grew spurs from the dragon's scale, but he found that the spurs caused more damage to himself than to any foe, so he altered the spell to its current version.

    Scattergloom [Dragons of Faerûn, Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Jalavaloss, Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Nurvureem]
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Area: 100ft-radius burst
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: No
    You create six areas of magical darkness within the area, which randomly and rapidly move about, giving concealment to nearby creatures. The areas of shadow (called "glooms") are the size of a Medium-size creature; they cannot leave the area of the spell. The movement of the glooms gives all creatures within the area one-half concealment (20% miss chance).
    This concealment applies to attacks made against or by creatures in the area. An attacker may ready an action to attack when he has a clear line of sight to the target, avoiding the miss chance.
    Two of the glooms are under your limited control. On your turn and as a free action while the spell is in effect, you can direct a controlled gloom to envelop a particular target and follow it. Each gloom can affect a single target of up to Medium-size in this manner, enshrouding it in total darkness. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the gloom. Success indicates the gloom goes on a random path like the others and does not remain affixed to the target, failure means the target is surrounded by magical darkness. Once directed at a target, a controlled gloom is out of your control. You can shape the controlled glooms to resemble a shadowy creature of Medium-size, including an undead shadow. They retain their shape even after you send them after a target, so it appears that the gloom is some sort of incorporeal creature that has enveloped the target. A shaped gloom has no other abilities, it cannot be attacked (dispel magic and similar spells affect it normally), and it is not susceptible to turning attempts.
    You can see normally through the glooms. This spell is often used to enshroud its caster (to conceal identity), with the second controlled shadow being "set" across a window or to block out light to conceal the presence of the caster.

    Scimitar of Sand [Sandstorm]
Evocation [Earth]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Druid 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Metal Master 2, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Kalamar) 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spirit Shaman 2, Wild Reaper 2, Wind Walker 2, Winter Warden 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: Scimitar of grinding sand
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A curved, 3-foot-long blade of sand springs forth from your hand, screaming and churning like a caged sandstorm. Attacks with a scimitar of sand are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d6 points of damage, +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The blade is not solid, so your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. You can use a scimitar of sand without penalty even if you lack proficiency with a normal scimitar. In addition to being dealt damage, a creature struck by your weapon must succeed on a Fortitude save or become dehydrated.
    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sand, salt, and iron filings.

Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
Target: One or more rays
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You blast your enemies with fiery rays. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

    Scourge of Force [Champions of Ruin]
Evocation [Force]

Target: One or more targets, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart
Effect: One tendril of force, plus one additional tendril / 3 caster levels (maximum 4)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    One or more whip-like tendrils of force spring from your hand and lash targets within range. Make a melee touch attack for each tendril using your highest attack bonus. If a tendril hits, it deals 1d8 points of force damage plus 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +5). You can lash a target with multiple tendrils.

    Searing Exposure [Sandstorm]

Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One living creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You expose the target to the effect of hours of exposure to severe heat and the desert sun in only a moment. The subject must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). Nonlethal damage that exceeds the subject's hit points is considered lethal damage. In addition, the subject is dazzled (as if by sun glare), dehydrated, and sunburned. Protection from heat and exposure (such as keep cool salve or a hydration suit; see Sandstorm Chapter 4) helps mitigate these effects, providing the target with a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save. A creature wearing heavy clothing or armor takes a -4 penalty on the Fortitude saving throw, but is not sunburned. Those that succeed on their Fortitude saves take half damage, are dehydrated, and are dazzled for 1d4+ 1 rounds.
    Arcane Material Component: A shard of thick glass.

    Seeking Ray [Player's Handbook II]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Duskblade 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A ray of electricity springs from your hand. It snakes around obstacles, cover, and other impediments on its way toward your target.
    You create a ray that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage if it strikes your target. While this ray requires a ranged touch attack to strike an opponent, it ignores concealment and cover (but not total concealment or total cover), and it does not take the standard penalty for firing into melee.
    In addition to the damage it deals, the ray creates a link of energy between you and the subject. If this ray struck the target and dealt damage, you gain a +4 bonus on attacks you make with ray spells (including another casting of this one, if desired) against the subject for 1 round per caster level. If you cast seeking ray a second time on a creature that is still linked to you from a previous casting, the duration of the new link overlaps (does not stack with) the remaining duration of the previous one.

    Sending [Player's Handbook]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 5, Ancestral Speaker 4, Apostle of Peace 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beguiler 5, Beholder Mage 5, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Court Herald 5, Crusader (base) 4, Dark Hunter 4, Dderwydd Chmdeithas Initiate 4, Deathwalker 5, Emissary of Barachiel 4, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fiend of Blasphemy 4, Fleshcrafter 5, Healer (Warcraft) 4, Herald Feat 4, Knight of the Chase 4, Magewright 5, Mask of Johydee 4, Mystic 4, Prime Underdark Guide 4, Savant (Divine) 4, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Trade Domain 4, Ur-Priest 4, Witch 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: See text
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round; see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You contact a particular creature with whom you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited normally by its Intelligence score. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.
    If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably, at the option of the DM.)
    Arcane Material Component: A short piece of fine copper wire.

    Sepia Snake Sigil [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]
Level: Anagakok 3, Bard 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Divine Bard 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Magewright 3, Savant (Arcane) 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Vigilante 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Target: One touched book or written work.
Duration: Permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days + 1 day / level; see text
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: No
    When you cast sepia snake sigil, a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book, scroll, or map. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is a line of effect between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell. The subject must deliberately read the text. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days +1 day per caster level have elapsed.
    While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regains spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of his surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides him with no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
    The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.
    Material Components: 500 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Target: One Large or smaller creature or object
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell releases whirling bands of force that speed from the caster's hand toward the target chosen. If the bands strike their target, they constrict tightly around the subject, preventing movement.
    The subject is completely paralyzed until the spell ends. An affected creature is still able to speak, breathe, and use any abilities that do not rely on movement, such as psionics and gaze attacks. However, all other movement is prevented. Shackled subjects can be lifted and carried by other creatures.
    A subject can break out of the shackles with a successful Strength check (DC 30). Incorporeal creatures that have no Strength score are trapped for the spell's duration. The subject has no chance of escaping through an Escape Artist check.
    Arcane Focus: A set of manacles.

    Shadow Canopy [Lords of Darkness, Races of Faerûn]
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 full action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Cylinder 25 ft high with diameter 100 ft + 50 ft / level
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: Will negates or none (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes or no (object)
    You create a field of shadow. The outer surface of the field is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, granting total concealment to creatures and objects within the area. A creature under the effects of a blacklight spell cannot see through the field. The interior of the field casts a deep shadow on everything within, reducing normal vision to 5 feet, though creatures with darkvision can see normally. Light, including sunlight cannot penetrate the field. Creatures normally affected by sunlight or light remain unaffected while in the area.
    You cast the spell on a point in space, but its effect is stationary unless you cast it on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect radiates from the creature and moves as it moves.
    Shadow canopy counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. Light spells of equal level have no effect on shadow canopy, but light spells of higher level counter or dispel shadow canopy.
    Material Component: A handful of coal dust and a dried eyeball of any diurnal creature.

    Shadow Shroud [Drow of the Underdark]
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Anagakok 2, Ancestral Speaker 2, Arcane Disciple 2, Archivist 2, Aspirant 2, Beholder Mage 2, Benevolent 2, Cleric 2, Crusader (base) 2, Deathwalker 2, Evangelist 2, Favored Soul 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Knight of the Chase 2, Mystic 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Ur-Priest 2, Wizard 2
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
    A thin membrane of darkness coats your body.
    This spell negates any penalties or other harmful effects imposed by your light blindness or light vulnerability. You also gain a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks made in areas of shadow or darkness.
    As with any darkness spell, the effect is suppressed if you enter the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.

    Shalantha's Delicate Disk [Lost Kingdoms of Faerûn]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Effect: One disk
Duration: Permanent until discharged (D)
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: See text
    This spell conjures a small disk, about 1 foot in diameter and 1 inch thick, made of a material that resembles rose-tinted eggshell. One you summon a disk, a single spell of up to 5th-level can be cast into it, either by you or by another spellcaster. If no spell is cast into the disk within 10 minutes of its creation, it vanishes into nothingness and the spell is wasted.
    The disck stores an imbued spell indefinitely until it is shattered (a standard action requiring only 1 point of damage or a DC 5 Strength check). At that point, the spell immediately takes effect as if it had just been cast by the spellcaster who first placed it in the disk. Touch-range spells and spells that have specific targets (such as inflict critical wounds or expeditious retreat) are targeted upon the creature or object that shattered the disk, while area and effect spells are triggered as though the broken disk were the spell's point of origin. For example, a stored fireball would detonate in a 20ft-radius sphere centered on the disk, whereas a flame blade would appear in the hand of the creature that shattered the disk. If the spell stored in the disk does not have a valid target (such as a disk imbued with inflict critical wounds that is broken by a falling rock), the spell simply fails to manifest and is wasted.
    Material Component: A golden egg worth 200 gp.

    Shard Storm [Dragon #323 (pg 80), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: One or more 20ft-radius bursts of piercing force
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Tossing the shard from your grasp, you complete the spell. An instant later, translucent shards of arcane energy blast the area you designated. In addition to deadly shards, the area fills with the chiming sound of shattering glass.
    Immediately upon completion of this spell, and once per round thereafter, you can cause minuscule shards of magical force to explode out in a 20-foot-radius burst from the point of origin. The storm deals 3d6 points of force damage to all creatures within the radius. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
    Each round at the beginning of your turn, creatures in the area take an additional 3d6 points of force damage. You can use a free action to suppress the storm for that round.
    Material Component: A small shard of clear glass or crystal.

    Shark Bolt [Dragon #334 (pg 76)]
Conjuration (Creation) [Water]
Level: Anagakok 3, Ancestral Speaker 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beholder Mage 3, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Crusader (base) 4, Deathwalker 3, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fleshcrafter 3, Knight of the Chase 4, Mystic 4, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Ur-Priest 4, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: 1 to 4 shark-shaped bolts of water
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: No
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates one or more bolts of water, each the size and shape of a small shark, that spring into existence and attack opponents within range as directed. The number of bolts created depends on the caster level, one per five levels (maximum four at 20th level). Each bolt deals 1d6 points of damage +1 per three caster levels. The bolts strike the opponents, that the caster designates, starting with one attack in the round that the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on the caster's turn. Each uses the caster's highest base attack bonus and attacks only once per round. The bolts always strike from the caster's direction. They do not gain or grant flanking bonuses. The bolts cannot use any of the caster's feats or combat actions. If the bolts leave the spell's range or go beyond the caster's line of sight, they return to the caster and hover until the caster redirects them.
    Each Round after the first, the caster can spend a move action to redirect all of the bolts to new targets. If the caster does not, the bolts continue to attack the previous round's target. A bolt may attack on any round that the caster changes the target, as long as the new target is within 30 feet of the previous round's target.
    Shark bolts cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but they are destroyed by any spell that dispels magic or destroys water. In addition, shark bolts within the affected area of a spell with the fire descriptor are also dispelled. A bolt's AC against touch attacks is 11 (10+1 size bonus for being a small object).
    If a creature attacked by a shark bolt has spell resistance, the caster makes a caster level check against the creature's spell resistance, whenever the bolt strikes the creature. If the bolt is successfully resisted, the bolt is dispelled. This dispels only the bolt that attacked the creature and not the entire spell, if other bolts are still in effect.
    Material Component: One shark's tooth for every bolt calling into existence.

    Shatter [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Sonic]
Level: Anagakok 2, Anarch 2, Ancestral Speaker 2, Anti-Paladin 2, Arcane Disciple 2, Archivist 2, Aspirant 2, Bard 2, Beholder Mage 2, Benevolent 2, Blackguard 2, Chaos Domain 2, Cleric 2, Corrupt Avenger 2, Crusader (base) 2, Death Master 2, Deathwalker 2, Destruction Domain 2, Divine Bard 2, Elemental Domain 2, Evangelist 2, Favored Soul 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Fury Shaman Domain 2, Gnome Artificer 2, Healer (Warcraft) 2, Knight of the Chase 2, Mystic 2, Pious Templar 2, Sha'ir 2, Sinker 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spellsinger 2, Ur-Priest 2, Vigilante 2, Wizard 2

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: 5ft-radius spread; or one solid object or one crystalline creature.
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates (object); Will negates (object) or Fortitude half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)
    Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that shatters brittle, non-magical objects; sunders a single solid, non-magical object; or damages a crystalline creature.
    Used as an area attack, shatter destroys non-magical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, and so forth. All such objects within a 5-foot-radios of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell.

Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

    The walls of the fortress cannot be placed so that any solid portion of one would occupy the same space as a creature. The stronghold may enclose a creature in one of its open spaces but not harm or trap it. For example, a squadron of soldiers could be arranged within the outer walls of the prospective keep in such a way that the walls would form around them, placing them in defense-ready positions inside.
    When the spell ends, the keep collapses into dust. A dispel magic spell used successfully against the keep affects only the area encompassed by the dispel magic effect (a 30ft-radius burst).
    Material Component: 10,000 gp worth of gems (agate, sapphire, and topaz) that have been crushed, mixed with clay, and formed into a crude model of the keep.

Target: Fog that spreads in a 20ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into a solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that the creature or object passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.
    However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
    Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
    Material Components: A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.

    Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).

The wave deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Unattended objects also take the damage. If the caster is a creature with a natural sonic attack, its effective caster level is its hit dice plus its caster level.

    Sonorous Hum [Savage Species, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Sonic]
Level: Anagakok 3, Ancestral Speaker 3, Arcane Disciple 3, Archivist 3, Aspirant 3, Bard 2, Beholder Mage 3, Benevolent 3, Cleric 3, Crusader (base) 3, Deathwalker 3, Divine Bard 2, Evangelist 3, Favored Soul 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Knight of the Chase 3, Mystic 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Ur-Priest 3, Vigilante 2, Wizard 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
    You finish casting this spell, and the area around you is abuzz with a low, droning hum that improves your concentration.
    After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast within the duration that requires concentration to maintain is maintained for you until the sonorous hum spell expires. This effect allows you to cast other spells, even another spell that also requires concentration. If the spell maintained by the sonorous hum has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would, and you gain no further benefits from this casting of sonorous hum. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 Listen check to detect). You can end the spell as a free action.
    For example, you could cast this spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this spell maintains the concentration on detect thoughts while you cast discern lies and maintain concentration on that spell yourself. You control all aspects of both spells, so you could change the orientation of the detect thoughts effect and select a different target for your discern lies spell in the same round.
    If you take damage, you must still make a Concentration check to maintain the spell.

    Spark Shield [Dragonlance Campaign Setting]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Crusader (base) 4, Deathwalker 4, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Knight of the Chase 4, Mystic 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 4, Wizard 4

Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell surrounds you in an aura of crackling electricity, both offering protection against electrical attacks as well as causing damage to each creature who attacks you in melee.
    Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attack takes 1d4 points of electricity damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If they strike you with a metal weapon, or are wearing metal armor, or carrying a lot of metal, they take 2d4 points of electricity damage plus 2 points per caster level (maximum +15). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you unless the weapon is at least one-half metal in composition (a spear or polearm is not).
    Against electrical attacks, you take only half damage. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    When casting this spell, you appear to be sheathed in tiny lightning bolts that undulate across your body. The electricity provides equal illumination to a torch (a 20 feet radius). The color of the electricity is blue-white, though the color can be almost any hue determined by the caster.
    Material Component: Two thin copper bracelets, one worn on each wrist.

    Sparkles [Shining South]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M

Range: Long (400 ft + 40 ft / level)
Area: 10ft-radius / level spread
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a cloud of multicolored, sparkling motes that shower down and attach to any living creature in the area. The sparkles visibly outline anything to which they stick, cannot be removed by non-magical means, continue to twinkle and glow until the spell fades, and visibly outlines invisible things in the area for the duration of the spell. Any creature covered by motes takes a -40 penalty on Hide checks.
    This spell is popular during festivals in Halruaa, where the wizards cast it over the cities from their skyships and lets the motes decorate the celebrants. However, others have found more practical uses for it, including exposing invisible and hiding foes.
    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of ground mica.

    Spell Fangs [Anauroch]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Effect: 30-ft.-long tentacle extending from your hand
Duration: Concentration, to a maximum of 1 round/level
    A spectral tentacle ending in multiple fanged maws springs forth from your hand.
    A more powerful version of toothed tentacle, this spell creates a shadowy tentacle of energy that extends 30 feet from your hand, splitting off into 1d6+2 smaller tentacles about 10 feet from its end. Each of these smaller tentacles ends in a fanged, slavering maw. All of these mouths can be directed to attack as a full-round action, or one of them can attack as a standard action. You can direct the mouths to attack separate targets as long as all targets are within 10 feet of each other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the modifier for the ability score that controls your spellcasting, and each deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. Damage done by the tentacles is gained by you as temporary hit points that last for 1 round.
    Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If a mouth is destroyed, it fades away into nothingness, but the other mouths remain. If all the mouths are destroyed, the spell's duration ends. The main tentacle cannot be attacked.
    Material Component: A hair and three teeth.

    Spirit Rending [Secrets of the Shadowlands]
Evocation
Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    By calling upon the mysteries learned by the Tsuno Soultwisters and their journeys in the Spirit Realms, you sever the connection between one target creature and a Spirit Realm it is not currently in. the most obvious and devastating effect of this spell is that the target immediately loses all benefits of any Ancestor feats (unless the target is within the ancestor's realm of residence). This also has the same effect as if you had cast dispel magic at the target, but only spells cast by creatures not native to the plane you are both currently in are affected.

    Splinterbolt [Spell Compendium, Far Corners- Cathedral of Leaves- Spells]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Druid 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Metal Master 2, Sha'ir 2, Shaman (Kalamar) 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Spirit Shaman 2, Wild Reaper 2, Wind Walker 2, Winter Warden 2, Wizard 2

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One or more streams of splinters
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You extend your hand toward your foe, flicking a single sliver of wood into the air, and a splinter larger than a titan's javelin whistles through the air.
    You must make a ranged attack to hit the target. If you hit, the splinterbolt deals 4d6 points of piercing damage. A splinterbolt threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
    You can fire one additional splinterbolt for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three at 11th level). You can fire these splinterbolts at the same or different targets, but all splinterbolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
    A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from splinterbolt is treated as magic and piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    Material Component: A splinter of wood.

    Spore Cloak [Races of Faerûn]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Druid 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Metal Master 5, Sha'ir 6, Shaman (Kalamar) 5, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Spirit Shaman 5, Sublime Chord 6, Wild Reaper 5, Wind Walker 5, Winter Warden 5, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level
    You become shrouded in a dense cloud of yellow mold spores. You can see through the cloud with ease and are not affected by it in any way, but it provides you concealment. The cloak of swirling yellow spores travels with you and does not leave a trail as you move. Anyone who passes through your square, or anyone whom you successfully overrun, bull rush, grapple, or who otherwise shares your area must make a Fortitude save or suffer 1d6 points of Constitution damage; another Fortitude save is required 1 minute later to avoid taking 2d6 points of Constitution damage.
    As long as the spore cloak is active, you are immune to fungal infestations such as the spores of brown or yellow mold and the rotting touch of violet fungi.
    If you fail a saving throw against a fire spell or effect, the spores are instantly burnt away and the spell ends. If you are in direct sunlight, the spell continues but the spores are inert until you reach shelter. Inert spores continue to provide concealment but cannot infest others and do not provide protection from fungal attacks.

Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three stars at one or more targets within range. You can only launch stars once per round. You must make a ranged touch attack for each star.

    Steal Summoning [Complete Mage]

Duration: Concentration (up to 1 round / level) + 1 round
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    With an act of will and the utterance of arcane syllables, you steal the nascent connection being formed between summoner and minion.
    You steal control of a creature as it is being summoned. If you succeed on a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the summoned), you gain control over the target creature as if you had summoned it.
    You must cast this spell immediately after the spell or spell-like ability that summoned the target resolves, before the creature takes even a single action.
    If this spell's duration expires before the spell that summoned the creature ends, the target returns to its original master's control at that time. If the original master is no longer available to control it, it becomes free-willed until its original master returns.

    Steelsting [City of Splendor: Waterdeep, Dragons of Faerûn, Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Jalavaloss]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Area: Cylinder 10ft-wide, 25ft-long
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Tiny pinpricks tingle over your entire body as if a swarm of needles is trying to emerge from beneath your flesh. As you complete the incantation, daggerlike shards of force burst forth from your skin.
    You create a brief maelstrom of daggerlike, flying darts of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area. All within the area take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The name is a misnomer, since the spell creates neither steel nor a true sting.

    Sticky Floor [Races of the Dragon]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Wizard 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Area: 10ft by 10ft square
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
Spell Resistance: No
    For an instant, a translucent sheen that only you can see falls across the area you designate.
    Creatures that are within or that enter the area of a sticky floor spell are immediately stuck in place and entangled. A successful Reflex save means the creature can move from its space but is still considered entangled as long as it remains in the area. A creature stuck in place can break loose by using a standard action to make a DC 15 Strength check or Escape Artist check. Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature within the area must succeed on another Reflex save to avoid becoming stuck in place again.
    The effect of this spell even extends through footwear, so merely removing your boots doesn't free you from the effect. Creatures not in contact with the surface of the ground (such as flying, burrowing or incorporeal creatures) are unaffected by sticky floor. Kobold sorcerers often use this spell to protect their lairs, and some theorize that they learned it from dragons.
    Material Component: A drop of hardened tree sap, which must be eaten by the caster.

    Stinking Cloud [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Blighter 3, Death Master 3, Deathwalker 3, Eyerlin's Harvester Wizard Specialist 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Gnome Artificer 3, Jester 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Urban Druid 3, Wizard 3, Wu Jen (Water) 3

Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.
    Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent stinking cloud dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
    Material Component: A rotten egg, or several skunk cabbage leaves.

Effect: One Medium earth elemental
Duration: 1 round / level

    When you cast this spell, you create a stone warrior that fights as you direct it. This stone guardian resembles a humanoid warrior, and is typically of the same race as the spellcaster. It uses the statistics of a Medium earth elemental (see page 97 of the Monster Manual).
    At the end of the spell, the stone guardian crumbles into dirt and disappears.
    Material Component: A small clay figurine.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: One 5ft-diameter stone sphere
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You toss the marble in the air, and it vanishes as you speak the words of the spell. A larger version of the marble, five feet across, appears in the hallway and bears down on your foe.
    You create a smoothly polished, 5-foot diameter sphere of stone that moves under your control at a speed of 30 feet. A stone sphere has AC 5, hardness 8, and 500 hit points.
    In the round when you cast the spell, the stone sphere appears at the spot you designate within the spell's range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the stone sphere in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a stone sphere in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action.
    If you move a stone sphere into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage.
    Material Component: A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter.

Effect: Up to 6 tentacles, no two of which may be more than 15 feet apart.
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    With this spell, you conjure tentacles of solid stone. The tentacles seemingly erupt from the ground, and can be created only upon a solid surface (they cannot be made to appear floating in midair or on water). You create one tentacle at 5th level, conjuring one additional tentacle every three levels after 5th (two tentacles at 8th, three at 11th, four at 14th, five at 17th, and maximum of six tentacles at 20th). Each tentacle cannot be farther than 15 feet away from another tentacle, with each tentacle 10 feet in length. Once conjured, the tentacles operate under your mental guidance, attacking those you command them to attack (a free action).
    The stone tentacles attempt to strike and grapple opponents. The tentacles are Large (-1 attack for Large size), attacking with a bonus equal to your base melee attack bonus, with a Strength of 19 (+4 modifier). If a tentacle strikes, it deals 2d4+4 bludgeoning damage and attempts to grapple. Multiple tentacles can strike the same opponent, but a separate grapple check must be made for each tentacle.
    Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may continue to make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal an additional 2d4+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Alternately, you can command the tentacles to hold without crushing; the tentacles will deal no damage, but gain an additional +4 bonus to grapple checks. The tentacles will continue to grapple until you command them to stop, until the spell expires, until the opponent escapes, or the tentacles are destroyed.
    Each tentacle has an AC of 9, 45 hit points, a hardness of 5.
    Arcane Material Component: A tiny cat-o'-nine-tails.

    Storm Hammer [Warcraft (pg 169)]

Effect: One force hammer
Duration: See text
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The caster conjures a magic force hammer and tosses it at the target.
    The caster must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit the target. The hammer deals 2d4 points of force damage, +1d4 points of force damage per 3 caster levels, and dazes the target for 1 round. (It deals 2d4 at 3rd level, 3d4 at 6th, 4d4 at 9th, 5d4 at 12th, 6d4 at 15th, and finally 7d4 at 18th level.) A successful Fortitude save negates the daze effect.
    Material Component: A tiny metal hammer.

Effect: Cylinder (5-ft. radius, 10 ft. high)
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a whirling vortex of sand. It flies at speed of 60 feet per round (perfect maneuverability), and you can concentrate on controlling its every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the vortex's movement is a move action, while changing its programmed movement is a standard action. If you don't move or program the vortex, it merely stays at rest, spinning and howling. The vortex dissipates if it exceeds the spell's range.
    If a storm mote enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d8 points of damage to the creature. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half.
    Those outside the vortex have concealment against those inside. The vortex extinguishes all nonmagical flame.
    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sand.

    A shower of lava globs and hailstones rains down for 1 round, dealing 6d6 points of cold damage and 6d6 points of fire damage to everything in the area. The cylinder provides concealment similar to fog cloud and also applies a -4 penalty on Listen checks made within the area. Movement costs within the area of the spell are doubled.
    At the end of the duration, the lava and ice disappear, leaving no lingering effects (other than the damage dealt).

    A sphere of crackling energy shoots out of your outstretched hand to strike a single creature or object. The ball of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the creature struck, and then encases the creature or object struck in a sphere of lightning and powerful wind. A successful Reflex save halves the damage done and allows the target to escape being caught; in this case the spell's duration ends immediately.
    If the target fails its Reflex save, it becomes trapped in the resulting sphere. The creature floats in the center of the sphere, held in place by the powerful wind. Projectiles cannot pass into or out of the sphere. A creature caught in the sphere must make a successful DC 20 Concentration check to cast a spell. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the trapped creature immediately takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (a successful Reflex save halves this damage).
    As a standard action, you can move the sphere by mental will to the limit of the spell's range. The sphere moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect). You can attempt to bull rush or overrun a creature with the sphere. It has an effective Strength score of 20 and Large size, for determining the modifiers to the attempt. Any creature successfully bull rushed or overrun with the sphere takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex save half). If the sphere is empty, a creature that fails this Reflex save also becomes trapped in the storm prison. A creature inside a storm prison as it is moved suffers no ill effects from any regions or hazardous areas you move the prison into, since the powerful winds and electricity around the creature shield it. Once the spell ends, though, this protection ends as well. If the creature was in the air at the time, it falls for the appropriate amount of falling damage.
    You cannot cause a storm prison to move through water or other liquids.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Up to one creature / level touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Your hand crackles with the pent-up energy of storm-tossed lightning, dealing 9d6 points of electricity damage with a successful melee touch attack. Touched creatures are also stunned for 1 round by the burning pain unless they make a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.
    Special: A character with any Mark of Storm dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Lyrandar), deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage with each touch.

    Storm Wall [Dragonlance Campaign Setting]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Opaque sheet of electricity up to 20ft-long / caster level or a ring of lightning with a 5ft-radius / caster level; either form 20ft-high
Duration: Concentration + 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An immobile, sparking curtain of radiant electricity springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth miniature bolts of lightning, causing 2d4 points of electricity damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of electricity damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creatures enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d4 points of electricity damage plus one point per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to metal creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, or carrying lots of metal objects.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a successful Reflex save. (If the creature ends up on the sparking side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.)
    The storm wall can be smothered by using enough dirt or sand to ground the electricity. For each cubic foot of sand used, one corresponding foot of the wall can be smothered.
    Material Component: A lodestone.

    Stormslave [Dragon #347 (pg 77)]

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Chains of lightning bind a target, entangling it and dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage each round. A target may escape by taking a full-round action to make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 30 Escape Artist check.
    Additionally, the target can choose to free itself from the chains of electricity by submitting to a charm monster effect. The target becomes aware of this option 1 round after the spell is cast. If the target allows this, the storm slave spell ends, and the target is affected as if by charm monster with no Will save (the target is considered to have consciously failed any saving throw).
    If the target of the storm slave makes its Reflex save, it is not entangled by the lightning and only takes 1d6 points of electricity damage a round. It may still end the spell by allowing itself to be affected by a charm monster effect.
    A creature that touches the target of the spell, takes 1d6 points of electricity damage.

    Strahd's Baneful Attractor [Dragon #348 (pg 76)]
Evocation

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You cause spells to divert from their original paths to strike the target. Upon casting this spell, you surround the creature with a 15 ft-diameter invisible aura that attracts spells aimed at nearby creatures. Any ranged spell that deals hit point damage and targets a specific creature within 15 feet is diverted to the target creature of this spell instead. The spell is diverted even if it would exceed its normal range. This aura does not pass though barriers that block line of effect.
    Any spell that does not deal any hit point damage is not affected by this spell.

    Streamers [Shining South]
Evocation

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: One or more streamers
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You cause a number of glowing, red streamers to shoot forth from your hand when you cast the spell. You may fire one streamer, plus one additional streamer for every three levels beyond 9th (to a maximum of four streamers at 18th-level). Each streamer targets one creature; multiple streamers can each be targeted at a different creature, or many streamers can target one creature. A streamer moves on its own, pursing its target without your concentration, hovering in the same space as the target with a readied touch attack. Whenever the target takes any sort of action, the streamer makes a touch attack against it (at the caster's base attack bonus). On a successful attack roll, the streamer deals 5d10 points of damage. If a target takes no actions for the duration of the spell, the streamers around it disappear with no effect.
    Streamers can be attacked (AC 20), but only magic weapons have any effect on them. Any successful attack destroys a streamer.
    Material Component: A 6-inch strand of red spider silk.

    Sudden Stalagmite [Spell Compendium, Far Corners- The Hidden Depths Below- Spells]
Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Metal Master 4, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wild Reaper 4, Wind Walker 4, Winter Warden 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: No
    You point your finger upward and utter a curt shout. Immediately, a razor-sharp stalagmite bursts from the ground to impale your foe.
    This spell creates a stalagmite about 1 foot wide at its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it reaches full size, it stops growing. The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell.
    The stalagmite deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). In addition, a target that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current location until it makes a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The stalagmite can be removed in other ways as well, such as with a stone shape spell. The victim can break free with a DC 25 Strength check, although doing this deals it 3d6 points of slashing damage.
    A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from sudden stalagmite is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: One summoned creature
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
    The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
    A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. For instance, a celestial porpoise may only be summoned in an aquatic environment.
    When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when used to summon a fiendish dire rat.
    Arcane Focus: A tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Ray
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A ray of burning sunlight springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the bolt is blinded for 1 round and takes 2d6 points of damage. Creatures harmed by sunlight take double damage. Undead always take double damage, as do fungis, molds, oozes, and slimes; undead damage by sunlight (such as vampires) always take triple damage. A reflex save negates the blindness.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: One object
Duration: 10 minutes / level (D)
Saving Throw: No
Spell Resistance: No
    When cast on a touched object, this spell channels the light of the noonday sun, the object carries an intense brightness about it: this light is so sure and powerful, that it is treated as natural sunlight.
    The object sheds the bright light of day in a 60 foot-radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures, in the affected area, that are vulnerable to bright light, suffer the full effects of that vulnerability while in the affected area of the appropriate light level.
    Sunlight brought into an area of magic darkness, overpowers and dispels the magical darkness, while still continuing to emanate its light, if the darkness is of an equal or lower level. If the darkness spell's level is higher than sunlight, both are temporarily negated and the normal light conditions exist in the overlapping area.
    Sunlight counters and dispels any spell with the darkness descriptor of equal or lower level.

    Sword of Deception [Complete Arcane, Oriental Adventures, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (All) 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: Pale green blade of force
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Swinging a miniature replica of a sword as if it were real, you bring into being a full-sized representation of your replica made entirely of pale green force. The blade immediately attacks your enemy.
    You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.
    The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.
    Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).
    If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled. If the target goes beyond the spell range or out of your sight, the sword of deception returns to you and hovers.
    Focus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.

    Tail Slap [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Effect: Evoked tail
Duration: 1 round / level
    A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you and savagely slaps at your foe.
    You evoke a dragon's tail that you can use to strike at a target once per round as a standard action (including the round in which you evoke it) that deals 1d6 points of damage per two levels (to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage) if you hit your foe with a melee touch attack.
    In addition, if a subject of up to one size category larger than you fails a Strength check (DC equal to your caster level + 12) against your first attack, the driving force of the tail slap pushes your foe back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of damage your foe takes.
    If a wall or other solid object prevents the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead slams into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage from the impact (no save). The movement of your foe caused by a tail slap does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The chance to push your foe back is only gained on the attack you make in the round when you initially cast the spell.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, has a chance to push back a foe with every attack it makes during the spell's duration, instead of just the first attack made in the round when the spell is cast.

    Tail Sweep [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 feet
Area: 10ft-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you and sweeps through the area, then vanishes as quickly as it appeared.
    You evoke a dragon's tail that savagely sweeps through the space around you in a 10-foot radius, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level to all creatures that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.
    Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also knocked prone.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.

    Temporal Jolt [Dragon #350 (pg 78)]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A colorless beam streaks toward your target, violently throwing the target back and forth in time, aging natural materials and damaging the brittle remains. The ray requires a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d6).
    In addition, the beam speeds the decay or corrosion of nonmagical items, aging them hundreds of years in a single moment. Nonmagical armor worn by an affected target permanently loses 1d6 points of Armor bonus (cannot go below 0) and nonmagical weapons being held are permanently destroyed. Armor reduced to an armor bonus of 0 is destroyed.
    Magical items cannot be affected by this spell.

Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: 3-ft-diameter disk of force
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range (by moving too fast or by such means as a teleport spell) or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.
    Material Component: A drop of mercury.

    The Sky is Falling [Fey Feature- Magic of Delight and Despair 2]

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 feet
Target: One creature / 3 levels
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Created by a court mage serving the Stag King of Athalantar, this spell provides you with a bit of breathing room when you are threatened by swarming foes. When you cast the spell, you project a blast of concentric force that pushes away creatures surrounding you. Each creature is affected as if it had been subjected to a bull rush maneuver by a foe of Large size with a Strength score equal to 20 + your caster level (maximum 25), and the attacker had moved with the target (though you need not move at all). Movement caused by this spell provokes attacks of opportunity, just as the movement resulting from a normal bull rush would. Creatures grappling you are not affected by this spell.

    The air around you crackles with the distant boom of thunder. A dome of translucent golden energy surrounds the spell's area. The dome shakes and rattles, while the muffled sounds of explosive blasts echoes from it. Any creature within the dome is knocked into the air by the powerful, ear-splitting blasts.
    This spell creates an area of turbulent, sonic energy. For the duration of the spell, any creature that starts its turn in the spell's area must make a Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of sonic damage. In addition, affected creatures must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature is already prone, failing this save has no effect on it.

    Thunderhead [Dragon #302 (pg 49), Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Anagakok 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Druid 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Metal Master 1, Sha'ir 1, Shaman (Kalamar) 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Spirit Shaman 1, Wild Reaper 1, Wind Walker 1, Winter Warden 1, Wizard 1

Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Black mist forms near the ground and sweeps upward to join a small cloud forming above the creature you designate as your target. Miniature peals of thunder erupt from the cloud.
    Thunderhead creates a small thundercloud over the subject's head. The cloud moves with the subject, following it unerringly even if he becomes invisible or leaves the region. In every round of the spell's duration, a miniature bolt of lightning leaps from the thundercloud to strike the subject. Each bolt deals 1 point of electricity damage that is negated by a successful Reflex save.
    Material Component: A small piece of copper wire.

    Thunderlance [Anauroch, Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Spell Compendium]

Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: A spear-like beam
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    A faint gray shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand.
    When you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks.
    You can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/◊3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.
    If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail on this check.
    Material Component: A small metal spear.

    Time Delay [Villain Design Handbook (pg 115)]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 1, Beholder Mage 1, Deathwalker 1, Fleshcrafter 1, Sha'ir 1, Sorcerer 1, Soul Reaper 1, Spellsinger 1, Wizard 1
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Target: One spell
Duration: 10 minutes
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell may be difficult to use in combat because of the strategic anticipation required. However, when cast, it will cause the effects of any other simultaneously cast spell to be delayed for 10 minutes. If used intentionally in conjunction with another spell, the source of the delayed spell might be masked. For example, a spellcaster could cast fireball in the backroom of a tavern, they would have a full 10 minutes to make their escape before the fireball went off.
    Material Component: A small metal cage.

    Toothed Tentacle [Lost Kingdoms of Faerûn]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Effect: 30ft-long tentacle extending from your hand
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round / level
    This spell creates a shadowy tentacle of energy that extends 30 feet from your hand, splitting off into three smaller tentacles about 10 feet from its end. Each of these smaller tentacles ends in a fanged, slavering maw. All three of these mouths can be directed to attack as a full-round action, or one of them can attack as a standard action. You can direct the mouths to attack separate targets as long as all the targets are within 10 feet of each other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the modifier for the ability score that controls your spellcasting, and each deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit.
    Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If a mouth is destroyed, it fades away into nothingness, but the other mouths remain. If all the mouths are destroyed, the spell's duration ends. The main tentacle cannot be attacked.
    Material Component: Three hairs and a tooth.

Range: Touch
Target: Piercing or slashing weapon touched
Duration: 1 hour or until discharged
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    You touch the weapon, and an oily liquid appears on its surface.
    When you cast this spell, you coat the target weapon with poison. The next successful melee attack with that weapon delivers the poison. The poison deals 1d10 points of Constitution damage immediately and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC equal to this spell's save DC).
    If the weapon has not scored a successful hit after 1 hour, the poison becomes inert and evaporates.

Target: Tunnel section up to 20ft-diameter and up to 50ft-long
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    You unleash the power of this spell, and the walls of the tunnel begin to roil and shift on all sides, clenching in rapid succession as they fling your opponents down the hallway.
    You cause a section of tunnel to flex with peristaltic convulsions, crushing its contents and moving them along its length in the direction you designate. Each creature and object in the affected tunnel section is crushed for 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and is moved from its former position to a point just outside the affected tunnel section. A creature that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage and is moved halfway from its former position in the tunnel toward the designated end of the tunnel section. When the spell duration expires, the tunnel returns to its former shape and size, with no harm done to its structure.
    Tunnel swallow affects both worked and natural tunnels, as well as corridors in surface buildings, but does not harm the structure.
    Movement caused by this spell does not provoke attacks of -opportunity.
    Material Component: A lump of chewed vegetable or meat.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One invisible, mindless, shapeless servant
Duration: 1 day / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell functions as unseen servant, except that the unseen crafter can be assigned any one task that can be accomplished by the use of the Craft skill. Appropriate tools and materials must be provided for the unseen crafter; it makes Craft checks using your ranks in the skill plus your bonus for the relevant spellcasting ability (Intelligence for artificers, wizards, and magewrights, Charisma for bards and sorcerers, and Wisdom for clerics).
    An unseen crafter can take 10 or attempt to work more quickly (as described in the Craft skill description, page 70 of the Player's Handbook), but this must be part of the command it is given when the spell is cast. Once the unseen crafter has completed the assigned task, the spell ends as if dismissed. If the unseen crafter leaves work undone, any creature or another unseen crafter can continue it.
    Special: When the unseen crafter is commanded to repair a warforged, it receives a +10 bonus on its Craft check.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: One invisible, mindless, shapeless servant
Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command it to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task which requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
    The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks). If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.
    Material Components: A piece of string and a bit of wood.

Components: V, S

Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level
    You speak the words of this spell, and tendrils of purple darkness rise from the ground, surrounding you and concealing you from your foes.
    Swirling wisps of darkness obscure your form, granting you concealment. The 20% miss chance is in effect even if the attacker has darkvision.
    This spell effect is dispelled in daylight or in the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.
    See invisibility does not counter a veil of shadow's concealment effect, but a true seeing spell does.

    The vile lance is treated in all ways like a +2 shortspear, except that the damage dealt is vile damage.
    Arcane Material Component: A bone fragment of a good-aligned creauter.

    Vipergout [Magic of Faerûn, Player's Guide to Faerûn, Savage Species, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Summoning) [See Text]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25ft + 5ft / 2 levels)
Effect: 1d4+3 summoned creatures
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A churning in your stomach overtakes you as you complete the spell. Something slithers up your throat, and you vomit serpents.
    This spell summons 1d4+1 celestial or fiendish Medium vipers (MM 280), which leap forth from your mouth to attack your enemies.
    A celestial viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite evil attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll.
    A fiendish viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite good attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll.
    Starting in the round you complete the spell, you can spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a move action. (Thus, if you move and then cast this spell, you cannot spit any vipers until your next turn, but if you cast this spell without moving, you can spit forth one viper as your move action in that round.) Spat vipers land at your feet in an adjacent square of your choice and act on the same round, on your turn, just as creatures summoned by a summon monster spell do.
    The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and they do not interfere with your breathing. However, until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech. When the spell's duration expires, all the vipers disappear, and any not yet brought forth are lost.
    When you use a summoning spell to summon a good creature or an evil creature, it is a spell of that type.
    Material Component: A snakeskin.

    Additionally, if you cast this spell while under the effect of see invisibility, true seeing, or any other spell that allows you to see invisible creatures, you can activate a faerie fire effect (as the spell) on any invisible creature or object within 60 feet as a swift action. Doing this ends the duration of vision of the omniscient eye; the faerie fire effect lasts for 1 minute.
    Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Spot checks.

    Wall of Chains [Book of Vile Darkness]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: A wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level (S); see text
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of woven, spiked chains to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surround non-living material if its area is sufficient to do so. the wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.
    A wall of chains is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5ft-square of the wall has 20 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.
    A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. Creatures who use a Strength check to breach the wall take 1d6 points of damage from the spikes and barbs covering the chains.
    Material Component: A single link from an iron chain.

    Wall of Coldfire [Frostburn]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 5, Fleshcrafter 4, Metal Master 5, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 5, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 5, Sublime Chord 4, Wild Reaper 5, Wind Walker 5, Winter Warden 5, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, Coldfire
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Opaque sheet of coldfire up to 20ft-long / level or a ring of coldfire with a radius of up to 5ft / 2 levels; either form 20ft-high
Duration: Concentration + 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An immobile, opaque curtain of frosty coldfire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of cold, dealing 2d4 points of cold damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of cold damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of frostburn damage +1 point of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum + 20) to any creature passing through it.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
    The opaqueness of the coldfire grants concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks made from the opposite side of the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of fire damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide fire damage by 4, as for normal objects.)
    Wall of coldfire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of coldfire that is extinguished by fire damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
    Coldfire Component: Three ounces of coldfire.

    Wall of Deadly Chains [Book of Vile Darkness]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
    As wall of chains, except as noted above, and the wall sports loose lengths of spiked chain that strike anyone within 5 feet of the wall. Those within that area take 3d6 points of damage each round.

    Wall of Ectoplasm [Ghostwalk]
Conjuration (Creation) [Ectomancy]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Anchored plane of ectoplasm, up to one 10ft-square / level, or hemisphere of ectoplasm with a radius of up to 3 ft + 1 ft / level
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates an anchored plane of ectoplasm or a hemisphere of ectoplasm, depending upon the version selected. A wall of ectoplasm cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ectoplasm is semisolid (not raw)-about the consistency of packed snow-and retains its shape rather than collapsing into a formless mass. Because ectoplasm is a ghost touch material, it is an impenetrable barrier to incorporeal creatures (although they may attack the wall or go around it). The ectoplasm is opaque and blocks line of effect.
    Ectoplasm Plane: A sheet of ectoplasm appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square per caster level (so a 6th-level wizard could create a wall of ectoplasm 30 feet long and 20 feet high, a wall 60 feet long and 10 feet high, and so on). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need be anchored only on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
    The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has hardness 0 and 2 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall without making an attack roll. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. A creature can break through the wall with a Strength check (DC 12 + caster level).
    Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. It is as hard to break through as the ectoplasm plane variation. You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures get a Reflex saving throw to avoid being trapped.
    Material Component: A cube of resin and a drop of oil.

    Wall of Fire [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Adept 4, Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Blighter 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 5, Fire Domain 4, Flame Shaman Domain 4, Flame Steward 5, Fleshcrafter 4, Gnome Artificer 4, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 4, Nar Demonbinder 4, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 5, Shaman (Warcraft) 4, Shugenja (Fire) 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 5, Sublime Chord 4, Wild Reaper 5, Wind Walker 5, Winter Warden 5, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (Fire) 4
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Opaque sheet of flame up to 20ft-long / caster level or a ring of fire with a radius of up to 5ft / 2 caster levels; either form 20ft-high
Duration: Concentration + 1 round / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. Once side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.)
    Wall of fire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of fire that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
    Arcane Material Component: A small piece of phosphorous.

    Wall of Force [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Force Domain 5, Guarding Domain 6, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Spellsinger 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5, Wu Jen (All) 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Target: Wall whose area is up to one 10ft-square  / level
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall of force cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force.
    The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.
    Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
    Material Component: A pinch of powder made from a clear gem.

    Wall of Fungus [Player's Guide to the Sovereign Lands (pg 246)]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 3, Fleshcrafter 4, Metal Master 3, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 3, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 3, Sublime Chord 4, Wild Reaper 3, Wind Walker 3, Winter Warden 3, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Effect: One wall of 10 foot area / level and 3 inches / level thick
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    As you wave your hands over the ground, a great wall of fungus rises at incredible speed.
    Wall of fungus creates a soft, slightly yielding mottled green wall that is 10 feet high, 10 feet wide and 3 inches thick per caster level. While the foamy texture is safe to touch, abrading it (attacking, charging, climbing, etc.) causes spores to shoot out violently, inflicting damage within 10 feet of the area touched. The spores inflict 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude save for half) to living creatures. Multiple touches result in multiple damage, so if three arrows miss a target adjacent to the wall and strike the wall of fungus, the target is subject to three spore attacks.
    Each 10-foot section of the wall has 1 hit point per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically (though hitting a specific area requires an attack roll against AC 10 + size modifier). A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 10 + caster level.
    The wall blocks line of sight and cannot move. Dispel magic will remove this barrier, as will a Dorama's disjunction spell, a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation.
    Material Component: A small mushroom.

    Wall of Gears [Planar Handbook, Spell Compendium]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Mechanus Domain 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: A straight wall of moving gears whose area is up to one 10ft-square / level; see text
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    You pop the gear into your mouth and make a humming, buzzing incantation. The sound takes on a life of its own, and springing from the ground is a huge wall made of machinery, all spinning, clattering and moving about, endangering all who are close to it.
    This spell creates a 6-inch-thick wall of moving iron cogs, wheels, gears, pistons, and assorted mechanical parts. Each 5-foot square of the wall's surface has hardness 10 and 90 hit points.
    Both sides of the wall have hundreds of moving parts that flail out, dealing 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within 10 feet. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
    Material Component: A small gear.

    Wall of Gloom (Ravenloft) [Van Richten's Arsenal Volume 1]
Conjuration (Creation) [Darkness, Fear]
Level: Anagakok 2, Beholder Mage 2, Deathwalker 2, Fleshcrafter 2, Sha'ir 2, Sorcerer 2, Soul Reaper 2, Wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Two 10 cubic feet + 10 cubic feet / 2 levels (S)
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    The spellcaster manifests a seething wall of shadow. The gloomy barrier provides concealment, and living creatures must make a Will save to be able to pass through it. If they fail, they become frightened. Shadows must succeed at a Will save to pass through the wall of gloom. If they fail, they treat the wall as a solid object for the duration of the spell.
    Should anyone attempt to cast a spell from the Shadow subschool through the wall, the spell is absorbed without manifesting any of its normal effects. (Nor does the spell break down into living shadows at the end of its duration.) Instead, the duration of the wall of gloom increases by 1 round per level of the spell absorbed.
    Material Component: A clump of black wool.

    Wall of Ice [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Auril Deity 5, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 5, Cold Domain 5, Crusader (base) 5, Death Master 4, Deathwalker 4, Disciple of Thrym 5, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 4, Gnome Artificer 4, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 4, Moshi School 5, Mystic 5, Ocean Domain 5, Sha'ir 4, Shugenja (Water) 5, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 5, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (Water) 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire, including fireball and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
    Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
    The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
    Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
    Hemisphere: the wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.
    Material Component: A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.

    Wall of Incarnum [Magic of Incarnum]
Conjuration (Creation) [Incarnum]
Level: Anagakok 3, Beholder Mage 3, Deathwalker 3, Fleshcrafter 3, Incarnum Domain 3, Sha'ir 3, Sorcerer 3, Soul Reaper 3, Wizard 3
Components: V, S, M, Essentia
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Incarnum wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level
Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    You cause a flat, vertical, opaque barrier of incarnum to spring into being. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object, but it can be adjacent to such. It must always be a fl at plane, although you can shape its edges to fit the available space. The wall of incarnum must be anchored to a surface, but this can be a floor, a ceiling, or even a wall. The wall of incarnum can't be moved once it is created.
    A wall of incarnum is 1 inch thick. It can be dispelled, but it cannot be damaged or broken, and spells cannot pass through it. Ethereal creatures can pass through it, but any other creature (including the caster) attempting to pass through a wall must succeed on a Will save or be blocked by the barrier. Regardless of the save's result, the wall of incarnum deals 1d4 points of essentia damage (or Wisdom damage if the creature has no essentia) to the creature.
    Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the wall of incarnum increases the damage dealt on a failed Will save by 1 point.
    Material Component: A tiny, shield-shaped piece of blue quartz.

    Wall of Iron [Player's Handbook]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 6, Metal Domain 5, Metal Shaman Domain 5, Sha'ir 6, Shugenja (Earth) 5, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Urban Druid 6, Wizard 6, Wu Jen (Metal) 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Iron wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level; see text
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
    A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
    If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must succeed at a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails take 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
    Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.
    Material Component: A small piece of sheet iron plus gold dust worth 50 gp (1 pound of gold dust).

    A blinding flash accompanies the completion of this spell as a wall of pure light springs into being.
    This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into being at any point within range. The wall is opaque to all other creatures, though you can see through it without difficulty. A wall of light has no physical substance and does not otherwise hinder attacks, movement, or spells passing through it, although it blocks line of sight for other creatures.
    A creature that passes through a wall of light becomes dazzled for the duration of the spell. Spell resistance applies when passing through the wall. Sightless creatures and those already dazzled are not affected by passing through a wall of light.
    A wall of light sheds light equivalent to a daylight spell. Wall of light counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.
    Material Component: A pinch of powdered sunstone.

    Wall of Limbs [Savage Species, Spell Compendium]
Evocation
Level: Anagakok 5, Beholder Mage 5, Deathwalker 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: A wall of whirling limbs up to 20ft-long / level, or a ring of whirling limbs with a radius of up to 5ft / 2 levels, either form 20ft-high
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    By flexing your arm and speaking the repetitive words of power, you unleash the spell. In the distance, the ground is covered in a writhing mass. As you watch, over the course of a few seconds, the writhing mass rises up and forms a wall of thousands of wriggling arms resembling your own.
    An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling limbs springs into existence. The limbs resemble your own forelimbs.
    A creature attempting to move through the wall takes 5d6 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or become stuck within the wall and unable to move (a charging creature gains a +2 bonus on the Strength check). The creature takes 5d6 points of damage each round at the beginning of your turn until freed. A creature can free itself with a DC 18 Strength check, or by dealing 30 points of damage to a 5-foot section of wall.
    A creature that starts its turn next to a wall of limbs must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be grabbed by the flailing arms and become stuck, as above.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.
    A wall of limbs provides cover against attacks made through it.

    Wall of Maggots [Dragon #300 (pg 57)]
Conjuration (Creation) [Evil]
Level: Anagakok 6, Beholder Mage 6, Deathwalker 6, Fleshcrafter 6, Sha'ir 6, Sorcerer 6, Soul Reaper 6, Sublime Chord 6, Wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Opaque wall of maggots up to one 5 ft-cube per 2 caster levels
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell causes a wall of pale white and yellow maggots to boil up from the ground. Any creature standing in the area of a wall of maggots when it is created may make a Reflex save to move to a randomly determined side of the wall before it forms. The maggots ravenously eat anything touching Them, causing 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d4) each round the creature remains in contact with the wall, this damage is not magical in nature, but the wall has damage reduction 15/magical (see below), so it damages many creatures with damage reduction. Affected creatures may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. Creatures caught in the wall when the spell is cast immediately take damage.
    Creatures inside the wail of maggots have total cover and are considered entangled. They cannot see or speak, maggots fill their vision and flood into their mouths. Casting spells with a verbal component is impossible, and a creature attempting to cast a spell with a somatic component must make a Concentration check (DC 20) or lose the spell.
    Anyone may attempt to move through the wall by making a Strength check or Escape Artist check, moving 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 15. For every round spent within the wall, the victim takes damage. Creatures partially contained in the wall (such as a 10 ft-tall creature standing in a 5 ft-cube of the wall of maggots) are considered entangled buT They can speak and see normally so long as the appropriate parts of the body remain free, they otherwise take damage and must make Strength or Escape Artist checks to break free as normal.
    A wall of maggots is immune to damage caused by piercing weapons. Against all other weapons it has damage reduction 15/magical. A single 5 ft-cube of the wall has 10 hit points per level of the caster. It is treated as an immobile object with no hardness.
    Material Component: A maggot drawn from a corpse.

    Wall of Magma [Sandstorm]
Conjuration (Creation) [Earth, Fire]
Level: Anagakok 5, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Beholder Mage 5, Benevolent 5, Cleric 5, Crusader (base) 5, Deathwalker 5, Druid 6, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Metal Master 6, Mystic 5, Sha'ir 5, Shaman (Kalamar) 6, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Spirit Shaman 6, Sublime Chord 5, Ur-Priest 5, Wild Reaper 6, Wind Walker 6, Winter Warden 6, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Wall of molten stone whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level (S)
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a wall of thick magma that glows with a dull red heat. It merges into adjoining rock surfaces, melting the rock at the point of connection to form a smooth bond. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, but the intense heat causes flammable materials in contact with the wall of magma to catch fire instantly. A wall of magma is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    You can shape a wall of magma into sheets and curves, but the molten wall cannot form domes or unsupported horizontal surfaces more than 5 feet across. The wall need not be vertical but must rest upon a firm foundation; it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. The wall cannot hold complex forms such as crenellations. It is possible (though difficult) to form the wall into a ring to enclose creatures, but they can avoid this with successful Reflex saves.
    The wall sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those pass 10 feet but within 20 feet. Unlike a wall of fire, both sides of a wall of magma radiate heat. Since it is molten, the wall cannot be broken as such, but an object or creature could force its way through. It costs 4 squares of movement to move through a square containing a wall of magma, but creatures of the earth subtype can pass through the wall at normal speed. A wall of magma deals 5d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to creatures passing through it, the same amount each round to any creature within it, and 2d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds after a creature leaves the area of the wall. It deals double damage to undead and creatures with the water subtype.
    The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell. If any 5-foot section of the wall takes 40 points of cold damage or more in a round, that section hardens into normal stone (hardness 8, 15 hit points per inch of thickness), which can then be chipped or broken as normal (DC 20 Strength check, +2 per inch of thickness). Do not divide cold damage by four, as normal for objects. Casting create water on the surface of a wall of magma creates a cloud of steamy fog that fills a cube with the dimensions of the length of wall affected. The fog dissipates after 10 minutes. Only the surface of the stone hardens; the wall is not cooled completely.
    Wall of magma can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of magma that is chilled by cold damage stays solid for 10 minutes, then returns to its molten state.
    Arcane Material Component: A small piece of pumice, obsidian, or other volcanic rock.

    Wall of Ooze [Book of Vile Darkness]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Anagakok 5, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Beholder Mage 5, Benevolent 5, Cleric 5, Crusader (base) 5, Deathwalker 5, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 5, Mystic 5, Sha'ir 5, Sorcerer 5, Soul Reaper 5, Sublime Chord 5, Ur-Priest 5, Wizard 5

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: A wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level (S); see text
Duration: Concentration + 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of festering, stinking organic ooze to bubble into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surround non-living material if its area is sufficient to do so. the wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.
    A wall of ooze is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5ft-square of the wall has 50 hit points per inch and hardness 0.
    A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 2 per inch of thickness.
    Any creature touching the wall takes 2d6 points of acid damage per round from the corrosive, burning nature of the ooze. Only the surrounding material that the wall initially is conjured to touch, such as the floor or adjoining wall, is immune to this damage. Furthermore, a creature that touches the wall must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed by the ooze. The wall then consumes the creature in 1d6 rounds, digesting it and adding the creature's full normal hit point total to its own.
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of ochre jelly or gray ooze.

    Wall of Salt [Sandstorm]
Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 4, Arcane Disciple 4, Archivist 4, Aspirant 4, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 4, Cleric 4, Crusader (base) 4, Deathwalker 4, Druid 4, Evangelist 4, Favored Soul 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Knight of the Chase 4, Metal Master 4, Mystic 4, Sha'ir 4, Shaman (Kalamar) 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Spirit Shaman 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 4, Wild Reaper 4, Wind Walker 4, Winter Warden 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Salt wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level (S)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates a gleaming wall of salt crystal that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls. A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp. If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half. For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.
    The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness. Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).
    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
    Arcane Material Component: A crystal of rock salt.

    Wall of Sand [Player's Guide to Faerûn, Sandstorm, Spell Compendium]

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    With a rush of hot air, a swirling wall of blowing sand leaps into being.
    This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
    Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
    Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
    Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.
    Arcane Material Component: A handful of sand.

A wall of scales is 1 inch thick per two caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    You can create a wall of scales in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion. It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or dome shaped enclosure about yourself or another creature.
    The wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by disintegrate spells and so forth. It is immune to acid and fire. In addition, the wall of scales has damage reduction 5/magic. For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level. Each 5-foot square of wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points are reduced to 0 is breached. It is not possible to break a wall of scales with a Strength check.
    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of scales, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
    Material Component: A pristine dragon scale.

Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. Thus, a 20th level caster can create a span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
    Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness, and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
    Arcane Material Component: A small block of granite.

Spell Resistance: Yes
    A dim, translucent wall of blue energy leaps quickly into being, then fades away to nothingness almost as fast as it arrived.
    Wall of thought creates an invisible, unbroken vertical wall that cannot move, is immune to most damage types, blocks ethereal and material creatures, blocks breath weapons and spells (except for gaze attacks, dimension door, teleport and similar effects) and is unaffected by dispel magic. Mental fortitude will breach this barrier, however (as will a Dorama's disjunction spell, a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation).
    A creature may force its way into the wall as a full-round action by making a Will save equal to (10 + caster level + caster's Intelligence modifier). Objects and creatures without an Intelligence score ignore the wall of thought.

Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    A wall springs up in the area you designate. Composed of a sheet of water rising vertically, the transparent wall does not prevent you from seeing beyond it. The water of the wall is calm as a lake on a windless day.
    This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
    Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
    Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.
    Material Component: A sponge.

    Wall of Water (Kalamar) [Salt and Sea Dogs (pg 46)]

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Wall of water up to one 10ft-square / level
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell conjures up a flat, vertical wall of water at a point you designate. The wall is one foot thick per four caster levels. The water's swirling, rippling surface makes it hard to see creatures on the other side, granting all creatures concealment (20% miss chance) versus attacks coming from the other side of the wall.
    Because the water in the wall is constantly rushing upwards before falling back down like a geyser, it is difficult to make accurate ranged attacks through the wall of water. Such attacks suffer a -2 penalty per foot of thickness.
    Any creature attempting to move through the wall must make a Reflex save or be flung into the air one and a half times the height of the wall (possibly taking falling damage in the process). Use the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram on page 158 of the D&D Player's Handbook to determine where flung creatures land in relation to their starting space. As the spell has no range increment, roll only 1d6 for distance thrown in feet. Charging or running creatures gain a +2 bonus to this save, and large creatures gain a +2 size bonus per size category above Medium. Conversely, smaller creatures suffer a -2 penalty per size below Medium.
    Fire attacks, including a fireball spell or red dragon breath, can evaporate a wall of water. If any 5 foot section of the wall of water takes more than 20 points of fire damage in a round, that section boils away, leaving behind a cloud of steam that dissipates after 1 minute (even beyond the spell's duration).
    Material Component: A small piece of lapis lazuli.

Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute / level
    You are surrounded by manifestations of the spirits of your long-dead ancestors, which provide you with protection in battle. Opponents gain no bonus from flanking you, as if you had the improved uncanny dodge ability (see the barbarian class feature on page 26 of the Player's Handbook; use your caster level in place of barbarian levels for the purpose of determining whether a rogue can sneak attack you).
    In addition, while this spell is in effect, you add your caster level as an insight bonus on any one Reflex save. Using this function is an immediate action and must be declared before the save is rolled. Using this ability immediately ends the spell, since the protective manifestations expend themselves to provide you with the sudden burst of insight.
    Arcane Material Component: A shred of a burial shroud.

It rises to a height of 20 feet before cascading back down as a heavy downpour. Everything within a 10-foot radius of the column of the water is drenched by this downpour. The downpour extinguishes open flames and has a 50% chance of extinguishing protected flames (such as those of lanterns). Within or through the downpour area, visibility ranges are reduced by half, and Listen, Search, and Spot checks, as well as ranged attacks smaller than siege weapons or giant's boulders, suffer a -4 penalty.
    The jet of water is extremely powerful. Any creature that comes into contact with it is buffeted violently for 1d6 points of damage during each round of contact.
    Creatures can attempt to fore their way into the jet of water with a successful Strength check (DC 17), suffering 1d6 points of damage as they do so, but it otherwise blocks line of sight and provides cover like a solid object of its dimensions. Creatures that fail to enter the jet suffer normal contact damage and are knocked prone outside the water spout square they attempted to enter from.
    A creature standing in the area of the water spout when the spell is cast can negate the damage by making a Reflex saving throw, provided that the creature can and does move out of the area by the shortest possible route.
    Although this spell generates a great volume of water, the elemental droplets are volatile and dissipate within 1 round. Thus this spell cannot be used to fill receptacles or drown an opponent.
    Material Component: A vial of pure water.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Webs in a 20ft-radius spread
Duration: 10 minutes / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc. - or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.
    Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
    If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, PHB page 150).
    The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - a torch, burning oil, flaming sword, and so forth - can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames.
    Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.
    Material Component: A bit of spider web.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates a whirlwind of solid air, akin to certain of the magic effects that hold Palarandusk together. It forms above a chosen target and stabs down in a single, unerring strike, hammering the victim for 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). A creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw takes only half damage.
    A Medium or smaller target who is on the ground that fails its save is knocked prone by the blast of air. If the target is flying, it is blown downward (1d6 x 5 ft. if Medium, 1d6 x 10 ft. if Small, or 2d6 x 10 ft. if Tiny or smaller, and Tiny or smaller creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from battering and buffeting in addition to the spell's primary damage). Large or larger creatures cannot be knocked prone or moved by this spell.
    This spell has no effect if cast underwater.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Wall up to 10ft / level long and 5ft / level high (S)
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An invisible, vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breathe weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).
    While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.
    Arcane Material Components: A tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin.

    Wingbind [Draconomicon, Spell Compendium, Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Arauthator, Forgotten Realms- Wyrms of the North- Hoondarrh]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    The flying creature lets out a surprised howl and then plummets to the ground, its wings flat against its body and struggling against a green glowing net.
    A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net. This spell functions like earthbind (page 76), except that an ensnared creature immediately falls to the ground, taking falling damage.
    An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the save DC of the spell. Like a wall of force (PH 298), this web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. Also like a wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disintegrate, a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction.

    Hazy wings of mist form at your sides, bearing you aloft. At your command, the wings transform into a great blast of wind or a cloud of fog.
    When you cast this spell, large wings of mist-resembling those of a dragon of your choice-form on your back. You can fly at a speed equal to your base land speed (maximum 60 feet) with good maneuverability. You can fly if carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor.
    As a swift action, you can choose to transform the wings into one of the two effects given below. In either case, doing this immediately ends the spell's duration (if you are flying when this spell occurs, you fall).
    * A 60ft-long line-shaped gust of severe wind (as the gust of wind spell; a Fortitude save negates the effect and spell resistance applies).
    * A 20ft-radius cloud of fog centered on you (as the obscuring mist spell; no save or spell resistance applies). The cloud created lasts for 1 minute.

    Wings of Bounding [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instantaneous
    Immense, partially translucent wings unfurl from behind you for an instant just before you jump, helping you achieve incredible distance or height.
    You evoke immense, partially translucent wings that grant you a +20 circumstance bonus on a Jump check you make in the same round when you cast the spell. In addition, if you are intentionally jumping down from a height and you succeed on the DC 15 Jump check to do so, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 30 fewer feet than you actually did.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, gains an additional +1 bonus on the Jump check for every two caster levels (maximum +10).

    Wings of Cover [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Instantaneous
    Immense, partially translucent wings unfurl from behind you and completely shield you from the sight of your enemies for a single heartbeat.
    Your evoked wings grant cover against a specific attack. If your foe is about to attack you with a melee, ranged, spell, or psionic attack, you can cast this spell immediately, creating a hemispherical barrier (or a spherical barrier if you are not standing on solid ground) of force shaped like dragon wings. The wings of force last just long enough to disrupt your foe's line of effect to you, providing you total cover against a single attack with a weapon, spell, or psionic power. Your foe's first attack in this round cannot be made and is wasted against you, though he could decide to take any other action, including choosing to attack one of your allies instead, or take a full attack action that grants him additional melee attacks against you in this round (if your foe is of high enough level to have additional attacks). The wings unfurl and then dissipate an instant later.
    Your foe could choose to attack the area in which you have taken cover with an area attack (such as a fireball spell). In this case, you gain a +8 bonus to AC (if applicable) and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, can provide cover for one additional adjacent ally for every three caster levels.

    Wings of Flurry [Races of the Dragon]

Area: 30ft-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Immense, scaled wings unfurl from behind you and beat at nearby foes in a savage flurry before vanishing as quickly as they appeared.
    You evoke flickering dragon's wings that strike at every target in range, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to all designated targets within 30 feet that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.
    Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also dazed for 1 round.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.

    Wings of Swift Flying [Races of the Dragon]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour / level or until underlying flight effect lapses; see text
    Immense, partially translucent wings unfurl from behind you and begin to beat expertly against the air, accelerating your flight.
    After you have already cast fly or overland flight or are enjoying some other temporary power or magical flight effect, you can cast wings of swift flying to increase your speed. This spell evokes ghostly, translucent wings that add 30 feet to your fly speed granted by the underlying spell for that spell's duration. When the underlying flight effect's duration elapses, the wings of swift flying spell also immediately ends.
    Only characters who are already enjoying the effect of flight granted by a spell, power, or other temporary magical or psionic effect can make use of this spell. Characters who are flying through some other means (such as natural wings of their own) gain no benefit from casting this spell.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, adds an additional 10 feet to her fly speed when this spell is cast (total 40-foot bonus to fly speed).

    Special: A red dragon capable of casting 5th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Area: 10ft-radius emanation from target creature
Duration: 10 minutes / level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    A faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds the target creature with a gentle breeze, bringing with it clean, breathable air. The magical sphere prevents noxious fumes and vapors from entering the area of effect, as well as mitigates the lack of oxygen from high altitude or in situations where the air is lacking oxygen. The zone of air is not strong enough to disperse magical fumes (such as that of a fog cloud, stinking cloud, or cloudkill spells), although it does temporarily displace the fumes from entering the area of effect if the target creature is passing through such areas.
    The zone of air does not function underwater, nor is the breeze strong enough to displace even the lightest of objects (thus provides no deflection bonuses).
    Material Component: A hollow glass bead.
