Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 1 day / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    The object touched sheds light brighter than bright sunlight, channeled directly from the celestial realms. The light extends to a 120-foot radius: bright light to 60 feet and dim light in another 60 feet.
    Creatures with light sensitivity take twice the usual penalty when they are within 60 feet of the object. Undead creatures take 1d6 points of damage each round they are within the bright light. Evil outsiders, as well as undead creatures that are specifically harmed by sunlight, take 2d6 points of damage each round in the bright light.
    Celestial brilliance brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
    Celestial brilliance counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as deeper darkness.

Components: V, S, M, Essentia
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / 2 levels)
Effect: One conjured midnight construct
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You create a single lesser midnight construct. The creature appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. As a free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The midnight construct acts normally on the last round of the spell's duration and dissipates at the end of its turn.
    Midnight constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit, using incarnum you coalesce. Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders or summoned creatures.
    Essentia: You can invest essentia in a midnight construct when you create it to gain one or more of the following modifications to the construct. Every point of essentia can be invested in any one modification.
    * Combat Power: +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per point of essentia invested.
    * Damage Reduction: Increase the construct's DR by 2 points per point of essentia invested.
    * Land Speed Increase: Increase the construct's land speed by 10 feet per point of essentia invested.
    Material Component: A bead of dark glass.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft / level)
Effect: A duplicate of yourself
Duration: 10 minutes / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Plucking out one of your own hairs, you make a beckoning motion. A double of you appears nearby.
    You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell. Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless, but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you. The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does. You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.
    The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' Spot checks as normal. Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature. The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess. A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise. Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.
    At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending. The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained. It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range. You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn. It can perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance-for example, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.
    The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices. Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human of 20 feet for a halfling). Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.
    The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it. If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.
    A Medium-sized fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift up to 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds. A Large or Small creature's fetch has the same strength but different carrying capacity and drag capacity. Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier). If gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class. It has no Constitution score and has 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. If can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points. The fetech has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.
    The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. Even if armed, it doesn't threaten an area around it and thus can't flank an enemy, nor can it use the aid another action to improve your Armor Class or attack rolls.
    The fetch has the same alignment aura as you do. Detect thoughts does not register its existence (since it has no Intelligence), but detect magic reveals it as a magical effect.
    Material Component: One of your own hairs.

Target: One creature
Duration: 3 rounds
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You conjure a band of energy that slowly squeezes your opponent. As the band tightens, it restricts his movement and eventually holds him in place, rigid with paralysis.
    This spell has one effect on an opponent when you begin casting it. At the beginning of your next turn, when you finish casting the spell, it has a second effect. When you start casting this spell, your target takes a -2 penalty on attacks, checks, saves, and AC. He also takes a 20-foot penalty to speed. This effect does not allow a saving throw, but spell resistance applies. If you fail to overcome the target's spell resistance, you immediately stop casting the spell, and the secondary effect does not take place.
    When you complete the casting of this spell, your target must make a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed. Even if the target makes this saving throw, this spell's initial effect continues to affect him for the spell's duration.
    This spell's duration begins after you have completed casting it.

    This spell creates a burst of magical energy that deals 1d6 points per level of nonlethal damage (maximum 10d6). Further, evil creatures that fail their saving throw become entangled by lingering threads of magical energy for 1d6 rounds. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity; the entangled target can move at half speed but can't run or charge. An entangled creature that attempts to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check or lose the spell. This spell affects only creatures-objects are unharmed.

Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    From the pearl you hold between your thumb and ring finger erupts a cloudy gray sphere of whirling air and howling wind that flies to attack your enemies.
    When you cast this spell, you create a violently swirling sphere of air. As a move action, you can make the sphere travel up to 30 feet per round and strike a creature or object you indicate as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by the sphere takes 3d6 points of damage from the force of its winds. In addition, Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Creatures that fall prone must then succeed on a second Fortitude save or be swept up by the sphere and driven 1d8◊10 feet into the air, dropping 1d6 squares from their original position in a random direction and taking falling damage as normal. If a window is within range, the subject is automatically thrown in that direction.
    If some obstacle prevents the subject creature from reaching its expelled height, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet of movement it was unable to complete, so that a creature hurled 50 feet up in a room with a 20-foot ceiling would take 3d6 points of damage from the impact, then take 2d6 points of damage when it falls back to the ground.
    The sphere can affect a maximum of one creature or object per round, and winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
    Focus: A gray pearl worth at least 100 gp.

Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: 20 ft-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This sadistic spell draws any creature in the affected area, down into the sand. This leaves the creatures buried up to their heads, exposed for the sun and scavengers to wreck havoc upon the victims. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save, those that fail their save are sucked into the ground. For most living creatures, this means being buried up to their necks. Creatures are never buried in a manner that prevents them from breathing.
    Once a creature is buried by this spell, it is rendered helpless, unless it can succeed a Strength or Escape Artist check (DC 15 +1 per 2 caster levels), as a full-round action. Spellcaster cannot cast spells with somatic or material  components, unless the material component is already in hand. Creatures not affected by this spell can attempt to aid another creature trying to escape.
    This spell can only affect loose earth, such as, dirt, mud, and sand. Particularly cruel spellcasters cast this spell on creatures that are in shallow water, in an area with tiny carnivorous vermin, or even use this spell and then cast transmute mud to rock.
    Material Component: A paper funnel and a handful of dirt, mud, or sand.

Effect: Five floating spheres
Duration: 1 round / level or until discharged
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text
    You toss each of the marbles into the air, making the incantation as you do so. Each marble turns a different color-pale green, white, blue, red, and violet-and settles into orbit around your head.
    You create a circle of five colored spheres that orbit your head at a distance of 1 foot. These spheres provide as much light as a torch and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic).
    If used to attack, on your turn as a standard action you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere deals 5 points of energy damage per five caster levels (maximum 20 points of damage) to a single creature, so an 11th-level caster's sphere deals 10 points of energy damage. The subject can make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere.
    If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage. Each sphere grants you energy resistance 5 per five caster levels. If a sphere is used to absorb damage, that sphere is destroyed.
    When used to attack a creature with spell resistance, make one spell resistance roll for all spheres that attack the target in a round. Success or failure applies to all spheres striking the creature that round.
    Material Component: Five glass marbles.

Effect: One quasi-real mount, plus one additional mount / 2 levels
    Your spell draws ether into form, creating a misty mount for you to ride.
    This spell functions like phantom steed (PH 260), except as noted here. You call into being one or more quasi-real mounts. These mounts accept only you and those that you designate as riders. The mounts appear as horses or any other commonly ridden mounts, but they have a foggy, almost translucent nature, and their colors shift across the spectrum over time.
    These mounts have AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex), and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. They do not fight and have no attacks. If reduced to 0 hit points, an ethereal mount melts into the ethereal fog from which it came.
    An ethereal mount has a speed of 240 feet on the Ethereal Plane and can carry its rider's weight plus 10 pounds per level. (If the Deep Ethereal is used in your cosmology, then the amount of time to reach destinations is halved while on an ethereal mount.)

    This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot - including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.
    Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.
    Once the tentacles grapple an opponent they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
    Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.
    Material Component: A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.

    Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.
    Material Component: A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.

Components: V, S, M, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
    This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
    Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
    When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.
    Warm Shield: the flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    Chill Shield: the flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    Arcane Material Component: A bit of phosphorous for the warm shield; a live firefly or glowworm or the tail portions of four dead ones for the chill shield.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 30 feet; see text
Area: Cone-shaped burst; see text
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    With a word and a gesture, you fill your lungs swirling, burning energy. Then, with a mighty exhalation, you flood the space before you with a powerful cone of fire. As the last wisps of energy leave your lips, your body becomes part of the breath weapon, allowing you to flow through space and reform your body anywhere within the breath's area.
    You breathe forth a cone of fire that deals 8d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies.
    When you cast this spell, you have the option of becoming part of the breath weapon and teleporting instantly to any unoccupied space within the breath weapon's area. Your entire body need not fit within the breath's area, as long as your new space shares at least 1 square with the breath weapon's area. You bring along any gear worn or carried (up to your maximum load). You can't bring along other creatures except for your familiar. You must make this decision when casting the spell, before any other effects of the breath weapon are resolved (such as saves, spell resistance, and so forth). You aren't damaged by the spell's effect when you appear within its area.

Effect: A 5 feet high moving wall of flame, up to 5ft-wide / 2 levels
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You create a sheet of devouring flames that move away from you at a steady speed, scorching anything in their path. The flamewave moves at a speed of 30 feet each round, in the same direction indicated at the casting of the spell, which cannot be changed. A flamewave moves over barriers less than 4-feet high, but it must travel across a solid surface. The flamewave is 5 ft. high and 1 ft. thick, and 5 ft. wide for every 2 levels of the caster. It ignites flammable substances.
    If the flamewave passes through a space occupied by a creature, the creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20). The flamewave deals double damage to undead creatures.
    Once the flamewave moves beyond the spell's range, it automatically winks out of existence. You may also dispel the flamewave at will.
    Arcane Material Component: A rectangular block of coal or incense.

Duration: 1 hour / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Letting the mercury drip to the ground you create a slightly concave disk of energy. It hovers several feet above the ground.
    This spell functions like Tenser's floating disk (PH 294), except that the created disk does not need to stay within 3 feet of the surface beneath it. However, the disk must remain within 15 feet of you at all times. You can concentrate (as a standard action) on the disk to make it move with a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect). This allows you to sit on the disk and command it to carry you about.
    Material Component: A drop of mercury.

Effect: Box of force 2 ft on a side
Duration: 24 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    Holding your hands as if to grip a box, you feel the pressure of one appear as you complete the spell. The password you choose to unlock the box echoes through your mind.
    This spell brings into being a lidded box of force. The box appears in your hands, and you can choose to make it either invisible or merely translucent. The chest has no weight worth noting.
    Solid walls of force form the chest's five sides and lid. You and other creatures cannot open the lid except by first speaking the password (determined by you at the time of casting). Both objects and Tiny and smaller creatures can fit in the box; it holds enough air to supply one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures for 1 hour.
    Like a wall of force spell, a force chest is immune to damage of all kinds and resists dispel magic, but it is susceptible to disintegrate and Mordenkainen's disjunction, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. The box is a spell effect, and Open Lock and Use Magic Device cannot open it.
    Material Component: A 2-inch-square glass cube.

    The claw is able to make attacks of opportunity against any enemy that provokes such attacks within the guarded area. It has a +10 bonus on the attack roll and deals 1d8+6 points of damage with a successful hit. It can make an unlimited number of attacks of opportunity each round, though it can make only one such attack per opportunity.

    Sparking bolts of blue magic, like giant magic missiles, streak from your outstretched hand to strike your foes and explode in sparkling bursts.
    You create powerful missiles of magical force, each of which darts from your fingertips and unerringly strikes its target, dealing 2d6 points of damage. The missile then explodes in a burst of force that deals half this amount of damage to any creatures adjacent to the primary target.
    The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total cover or concealment. A caster cannot single out specific parts of a creature. The spell can target and damage unattended objects.
    You gain one missile for every four caster levels. You can make more than one missile strike a single target, if desired. However, you must designate targets before rolling for spell resistance or damage.

    You cause the River of Time surrounding the target object's essence or the target creature's soul to stop flowing, but for only a few seconds. This immobilizes that creature or object in place. Everything around the target proceeds as normal, but the region of stopped time encasing the target makes it completely invulnerable to attacks, spells, and damage of any sort while the frozen moment is in effect. This spell does not affect anything larger than a Medium creature - it cannot be used to stop an elephant in its tracks, or to prevent a wagon from toppling over a cliff.

    You cause the River of Time surrounding the target object's essence or the target creature's soul to stop flowing, but for only a few seconds. This immobilizes that creature or object in place. Everything around the target proceeds as normal, but the region of stopped time encasing the target makes it completely invulnerable to attacks, spells, and damage of any sort while the frozen moment is in effect. This spell does not affect anything larger than a Medium creature - it cannot be used to stop an elephant in its tracks, or to prevent a wagon from toppling over a cliff.
    Material Component: A drop of water.

Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 day / level or permanent; see text
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No
    One of the deepest secrets of the Tsuno Soultwisters, this spell allows the Tsuno to travel between the planes without suffering the ill effects of a Spirit realm's touch. The target becomes immune to any effects of a Spirit Realm's control, though he accumulates points of control normally. Affected creatures gain no special abilities or status effects due to these levels of control, but may be targeted and affected by effects that check for such levels of control. For example, although a creature under the effect of this spell would accumulate points of Shadowlands Taint, he would suffer no ill effects from the taint and could not draw upon the Taint for powers, but he would still be wounded by a jade strike. This spell normally lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. Casters of level 12 or higher may choose, at casting, to make effects permanent until either dispelled or changed by another casting of this spell.

    Ice Web [Frostburn]
Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, Coldfire
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Webs of coldfire in a 20ft-radius spread
Duration: 10 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
    Ice web creates a many-layered mass of strong, frigid strands of pure coldfire. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points-floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like - or else the ice web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within the ice web become entangled in the strands. Attacking a creature in an ice web won't cause you to become entangled.
    Any creature moving into or through the spell's area takes 1d6 points of frostburn damage per round.
    In addition, anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the ice web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
    If you have at least 5 feet of ice web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of ice web between you, it provides total cover.
    The strands of an ice web are immune to damage from cold. Any fire-a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth-can melt 5 square feet of coldfire strands in 1 round.
    Ice web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent ice web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.
    Creatures with the cold subtype may pass unimpeded and unharmed through an ice web.
    Coldfire Component: Two ounces of coldfire.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You cause a creature to burn from within. When the spell is first cast upon a creature, it is allowed a Fortitude save to shake off the spell completely. If the victim fails his initial saving throw, he takes an immediate 1d6 points fire damage. In each subsequent round following the first, the victim must make an additional Fortitude save or suffer another 1d6 points of fire damage. The internal flames continue to burn for as long as you maintain concentration, or until the spell has dealt a maximum of 15d6 points of damage
    If the creature dies as a result of this spell (is brought to -10 hp or lower), then the victim's body is instantly consumed by flame, leaving behind of ash (and thus making it very difficult to use spell such as raise dead, although there is enough "remains" for a reincarnation or resurrection spell), although the victim's possessions remain mostly untouched as the body incinerates almost instantaneously.
    Material Component: A ball of wax filled with ash from a funeral pyre.

Components: V, S, M, F
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
Target: 20ft-square structure
Duration: 2 hours / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast - stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
    The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise - it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants).
    The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
    The secure shelter contains rude furnishings - eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
    Material Components: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, and a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) and the focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if these benefits are to be included.

Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area: 30-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    You call upon the powerful magnetic forces of the vast lodes of metal hidden deep within the mountains to focus on a specific point in range. All unattended ferrous metallic objects that weigh less than 10 pounds per caster level are immediately hurled in a random direction to a point just beyond the area of the spell's burst. All creatures in the area take 5d6 points of damage. Alternatively, you can direct the spell inward, and all unattended ferrous metallic objects are hurled toward the center of the area; this inflicts 3d6 points of damage to all of the objects and to all creatures in the area . A successful Reflex saving throw negates the damage done by either type of magnetic pulse.
    Attended ferrous metal objects are affected differently by this spell. Fairly small ferrous metal objects worn on the body (such as jewelry) are whisked off the creature's body unless he makes a Reflex save. Most jewelry pieces (especially magic items), however, are not made of ferrous metal. Characters in ferrous metal armor (which is most metal armor) are subjected to a trip attack made by a Large creature with an effective Strength of 22 (the bonus on the trip attack is +4 for size and +6 for Strength for a total bonus of +10). Similarly, the spell makes a disarm attack (using your base attack bonus + 6 for the spell's effective Strength) against any ferrous weapons or objects held in an affected creature's hands. Creatures made primarily of ferrous metal (such as iron golems) are subjected to a bull rush attack from a Large creature. The effective Strength is 22 (+4 size and +6 Strength for +10 bonus on the check) in the direction of the pulse.
    If this spell is cast in mountainous terrain, the area is doubled to a 60-foot-radius burst, and the pulse's effective Strength score increases to 30 (+10 Strength bonus).
    Material Component: A lodestone.

    Your entire body sparkles as color fades from your form. A stiff breezes picks up as you collapse into thousands of particles of sand, sent flying on the warm wind.
    You and your belongings become a flying cloud of sand, swirling and formless yet retaining your consciousness. You lose your normal shape and become a sand cloud, taking up the same space you do in your normal form. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet (perfect maneuverability), but you lose any other movement rates you had in your normal form. Treat this otherwise as gaseous form.
    If you end your movement in the same space as another creature, that creature is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Spell resistance does not apply against this effect.
    Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a gust of wind effect (as the spell) as a swift action. Doing so ends the duration of passage of the shifting sands.

Target: Fog that spreads in a 20ft-radius, 20ft-high
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into a solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that the creature or object passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.
    However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
    Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
    Material Components: A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.

    Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is sonic-based. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

Duration: 1 round / level (D)
    You complete the spell and watch in satisfaction as the swirling, mist-like aura surrounds you.
    The spell wreathes you in a swirling aura and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The aura also protects you from either acid-based or electricity-based attacks (your choice).
    Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is sonic-based. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
    When casting this spell, you appear surrounded by an aura, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the aura is determine randomly (50% chance of either color) - green or purple if the acid shield is employed, white or yellow if the shock shield is cast. The special powers of each version are as follows.
    Acid Shield: The aura is stinging to the touch. You take only half damage from acid-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    Shock Shield: The aura is tingling to the touch. You take only half damage from electricity-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

    This spell surrounds you in an aura of crackling electricity, both offering protection against electrical attacks as well as causing damage to each creature who attacks you in melee.
    Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attack takes 1d4 points of electricity damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If they strike you with a metal weapon, or are wearing metal armor, or carrying a lot of metal, they take 2d4 points of electricity damage plus 2 points per caster level (maximum +15). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you unless the weapon is at least one-half metal in composition (a spear or polearm is not).
    Against electrical attacks, you take only half damage. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
    When casting this spell, you appear to be sheathed in tiny lightning bolts that undulate across your body. The electricity provides equal illumination to a torch (a 20 feet radius). The color of the electricity is blue-white, though the color can be almost any hue determined by the caster.
    Material Component: Two thin copper bracelets, one worn on each wrist.

    You create a cloud of multicolored, sparkling motes that shower down and attach to any living creature in the area. The sparkles visibly outline anything to which they stick, cannot be removed by non-magical means, continue to twinkle and glow until the spell fades, and visibly outlines invisible things in the area for the duration of the spell. Any creature covered by motes takes a -40 penalty on Hide checks.
    This spell is popular during festivals in Halruaa, where the wizards cast it over the cities from their skyships and lets the motes decorate the celebrants. However, others have found more practical uses for it, including exposing invisible and hiding foes.
    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of ground mica.

Effect: 30-ft.-long tentacle extending from your hand
Duration: Concentration, to a maximum of 1 round/level
    A spectral tentacle ending in multiple fanged maws springs forth from your hand.
    A more powerful version of toothed tentacle, this spell creates a shadowy tentacle of energy that extends 30 feet from your hand, splitting off into 1d6+2 smaller tentacles about 10 feet from its end. Each of these smaller tentacles ends in a fanged, slavering maw. All of these mouths can be directed to attack as a full-round action, or one of them can attack as a standard action. You can direct the mouths to attack separate targets as long as all targets are within 10 feet of each other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the modifier for the ability score that controls your spellcasting, and each deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. Damage done by the tentacles is gained by you as temporary hit points that last for 1 round.
    Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If a mouth is destroyed, it fades away into nothingness, but the other mouths remain. If all the mouths are destroyed, the spell's duration ends. The main tentacle cannot be attacked.
    Material Component: A hair and three teeth.

Duration: 1 minute / level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
    By calling upon the mysteries learned by the Tsuno Soultwisters and their journeys in the Spirit Realms, you sever the connection between one target creature and a Spirit Realm it is not currently in. the most obvious and devastating effect of this spell is that the target immediately loses all benefits of any Ancestor feats (unless the target is within the ancestor's realm of residence). This also has the same effect as if you had cast dispel magic at the target, but only spells cast by creatures not native to the plane you are both currently in are affected.

    You create a brief maelstrom of daggerlike, flying darts of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area. All within the area take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The name is a misnomer, since the spell creates neither steel nor a true sting.

Effect: One 5ft-diameter stone sphere
Duration: 1 round / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    You toss the marble in the air, and it vanishes as you speak the words of the spell. A larger version of the marble, five feet across, appears in the hallway and bears down on your foe.
    You create a smoothly polished, 5-foot diameter sphere of stone that moves under your control at a speed of 30 feet. A stone sphere has AC 5, hardness 8, and 500 hit points.
    In the round when you cast the spell, the stone sphere appears at the spot you designate within the spell's range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the stone sphere in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a stone sphere in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action.
    If you move a stone sphere into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage.
    Material Component: A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter.

Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    An immobile, sparking curtain of radiant electricity springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth miniature bolts of lightning, causing 2d4 points of electricity damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of electricity damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creatures enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d4 points of electricity damage plus one point per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to metal creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, or carrying lots of metal objects.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a successful Reflex save. (If the creature ends up on the sparking side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.)
    The storm wall can be smothered by using enough dirt or sand to ground the electricity. For each cubic foot of sand used, one corresponding foot of the wall can be smothered.
    Material Component: A lodestone.

Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: No
    You point your finger upward and utter a curt shout. Immediately, a razor-sharp stalagmite bursts from the ground to impale your foe.
    This spell creates a stalagmite about 1 foot wide at its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it reaches full size, it stops growing. The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell.
    The stalagmite deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). In addition, a target that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current location until it makes a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The stalagmite can be removed in other ways as well, such as with a stone shape spell. The victim can break free with a DC 25 Strength check, although doing this deals it 3d6 points of slashing damage.
    A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from sudden stalagmite is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

    Sword of Deception [Complete Arcane, Oriental Adventures, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (All) 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100ft + 10ft / level)
Effect: Pale green blade of force
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    Swinging a miniature replica of a sword as if it were real, you bring into being a full-sized representation of your replica made entirely of pale green force. The blade immediately attacks your enemy.
    You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.
    The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.
    Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).
    If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled. If the target goes beyond the spell range or out of your sight, the sword of deception returns to you and hovers.
    Focus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.

Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S

Range: 10 feet
Area: 10ft-radius burst

    A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you and sweeps through the area, then vanishes as quickly as it appeared.
    You evoke a dragon's tail that savagely sweeps through the space around you in a 10-foot radius, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level to all creatures that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.

Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
    A colorless beam streaks toward your target, violently throwing the target back and forth in time, aging natural materials and damaging the brittle remains. The ray requires a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d6).
    In addition, the beam speeds the decay or corrosion of nonmagical items, aging them hundreds of years in a single moment. Nonmagical armor worn by an affected target permanently loses 1d6 points of Armor bonus (cannot go below 0) and nonmagical weapons being held are permanently destroyed. Armor reduced to an armor bonus of 0 is destroyed.
    Magical items cannot be affected by this spell.

    Thunderlance [Anauroch, Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Spell Compendium]
Evocation [Force]
Level: Anagakok 4, Beholder Mage 4, Deathwalker 4, Fleshcrafter 4, Sha'ir 4, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 feet
Effect: A spear-like beam
Duration: 1 round / level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
    A faint gray shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand.
    When you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks.
    You can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/◊3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.
    If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail on this check.
    Material Component: A small metal spear.

    An immobile, opaque curtain of frosty coldfire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of cold, dealing 2d4 points of cold damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of cold damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of frostburn damage +1 point of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum + 20) to any creature passing through it.
    If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
    The opaqueness of the coldfire grants concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks made from the opposite side of the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of fire damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide fire damage by 4, as for normal objects.)
    Wall of coldfire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of coldfire that is extinguished by fire damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
    Coldfire Component: Three ounces of coldfire.

    As you wave your hands over the ground, a great wall of fungus rises at incredible speed.
    Wall of fungus creates a soft, slightly yielding mottled green wall that is 10 feet high, 10 feet wide and 3 inches thick per caster level. While the foamy texture is safe to touch, abrading it (attacking, charging, climbing, etc.) causes spores to shoot out violently, inflicting damage within 10 feet of the area touched. The spores inflict 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude save for half) to living creatures. Multiple touches result in multiple damage, so if three arrows miss a target adjacent to the wall and strike the wall of fungus, the target is subject to three spore attacks.
    Each 10-foot section of the wall has 1 hit point per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically (though hitting a specific area requires an attack roll against AC 10 + size modifier). A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 10 + caster level.
    The wall blocks line of sight and cannot move. Dispel magic will remove this barrier, as will a Dorama's disjunction spell, a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation.
    Material Component: A small mushroom.

    Wall of Ice [Player's Handbook]
Evocation [Cold]
Level: Anagakok 4, Ancestral Speaker 5, Arcane Disciple 5, Archivist 5, Aspirant 5, Auril Deity 5, Beholder Mage 4, Benevolent 5, Cold Domain 5, Crusader (base) 5, Death Master 4, Deathwalker 4, Disciple of Thrym 5, Evangelist 5, Favored Soul 5, Fleshcrafter 4, Gnome Artificer 4, Mazes of Loet-Rab Wizard Specialist 4, Moshi School 5, Mystic 5, Ocean Domain 5, Sha'ir 4, Shugenja (Water) 5, Sorcerer 4, Soul Reaper 4, Sublime Chord 4, Ur-Priest 5, Wizard 4, Wu Jen (Water) 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Target: Anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level
Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
    This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire, including fireball and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
    Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
    The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
    Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
    Hemisphere: the wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.
    Material Component: A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.

Components: V, S, M, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)
Effect: Salt wall whose area is up to one 5ft-square / level (S)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    This spell creates a gleaming wall of salt crystal that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls. A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp. If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half. For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.
    The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness. Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).
    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
    Arcane Material Component: A crystal of rock salt.

    With a rush of hot air, a swirling wall of blowing sand leaps into being.
    This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
    Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
    Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
    Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.
    Arcane Material Component: A handful of sand.

    Wall of Scales [Races of the Dragon]
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Sorcerer 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft + 10 ft / level)

Duration: 1 minute / level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
    You blow a dragon scale from your palm, and before you sprouts a wall of glittering scales, pulsing like living flesh.
    You create a barrier of living dragonhide that is anchored to the ground or floor, or between two vertical surfaces. A wall of scales is 1 inch thick per two caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
    You can create a wall of scales in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion. It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or dome shaped enclosure about yourself or another creature.
    The wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by disintegrate spells and so forth. It is immune to acid and fire. In addition, the wall of scales has damage reduction 5/magic. For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level. Each 5-foot square of wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points are reduced to 0 is breached. It is not possible to break a wall of scales with a Strength check.
    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of scales, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
    Material Component: A pristine dragon scale.

Spell Resistance: No
    A wall springs up in the area you designate. Composed of a sheet of water rising vertically, the transparent wall does not prevent you from seeing beyond it. The water of the wall is calm as a lake on a windless day.
    This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
    Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
    Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.

Opponents gain no bonus from flanking you, as if you had the improved uncanny dodge ability (see the barbarian class feature on page 26 of the Player's Handbook; use your caster level in place of barbarian levels for the purpose of determining whether a rogue can sneak attack you).
    In addition, while this spell is in effect, you add your caster level as an insight bonus on any one Reflex save. Using this function is an immediate action and must be declared before the save is rolled. Using this ability immediately ends the spell, since the protective manifestations expend themselves to provide you with the sudden burst of insight.

    The flying creature lets out a surprised howl and then plummets to the ground, its wings flat against its body and struggling against a green glowing net.
    A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net. This spell functions like earthbind (page 76), except that an ensnared creature immediately falls to the ground, taking falling damage.
    An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the save DC of the spell. Like a wall of force (PH 298), this web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. Also like a wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disintegrate, a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction.

    Immense, scaled wings unfurl from behind you and beat at nearby foes in a savage flurry before vanishing as quickly as they appeared.
    You evoke flickering dragon's wings that strike at every target in range, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to all designated targets within 30 feet that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.
    Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also dazed for 1 round.
    Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
